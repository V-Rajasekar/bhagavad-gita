The Supreme Lord said: In this world, there is a two-fold path as stated by me earlier O sinless one; Yoga of knowledge for saankhyas and yoga of action for yogis.

**Shri Bhagavan Uvacha**
The Infinite is communicating to us always. Whether we call it God or Nature or by some other name, we recognize that there is a higher power. The Guru Shakti which is an aspect of the Infinite is always communicating to us and guiding us. We just have to attune to it. Speech is just one form of communication. If we fortify our vessel and become a Supatra, the wisdom will flow into it.

**Sadhana homework**
For 2-3 minutes daily after Sadhana, `chant Shri Bhagavan Uvacha` to yourself and as you chant think of the Infinite; I am the Jivatma or individual soul opening up to the Infinite with ultimate devotion and surrender. Chant for about five times and just be silent each time.

**Shri Bhagawan Uvacha**
This represents the Guru Tattva and the Guru Shakti within us that is always teaching us. The six qualities of Bhagawan: Power, Dharma (righteousness), Shri (abundance), Gnyana (wisdom), Vairagya (detachment) and one more.

As we start attaining parts of these six qualities, recognize that this is the Infinite manifesting and it's actually not me. Do the same anytime anything good happens to me. Watch out for the ego which is always waiting to trade on the spiritual powers, like it did with Ravana and Hiranyakashipu. Anytime anything good happens to me, think and feel "Shri Bhagawan Uvacha".

Shri Hanuman's surrender to Rama was so complete, that his utterance of Shri Rama saved him from the very arrows of Rama.

When Arjuna was speaking, he had actually made some mild accusations against Krishna. Krishna's reply was classic. He ignores the accusations and just gets to the point "In this world, there are two kinds of people ...". That's because has absolutely no ego and only unconditional love.

**Sadhana Tip**
Do not personalize it.
The other person is personalizing it when they insult you. The best way to counter is to actually not be affected. Do not personalize it. This is an internal attitude. You still need to take the correct action.

When Shishupala insulted Krishna numerous times in Yudhishtira's Raja Suya Yagna, Krishna was calm while others got very angry. Krishna killed (liberated) Shishupala only after 100 insults following a vow he had previously made to Shishupala's mother.

During Yoga Sankirtan Sadhana, go with the flow and do deep breathing when impressions are released. Do not be impatient. The impresssions have been accumulated over thousands of births.

Arjuna Uvacha is the individual soul (me) seeking and Bhagawan Uvacha is the Infinite responding. The Infinite responds to those who truly seek. You need to be aligned in speech, action, emotions and thoughts in your seeking. Arjuna was supremely focused as shown in the following incident before his Acharya and other students. Drona kept a wooden bird on a tree and asked his archery students to shoot the eye. First he asked each of them what they saw. Duryodhana saw the people and the land, others saw the tree and the leaves, Bheema saw the apples hanging from the tree and Yudhishtira saw a fledgling nest in the tree that shouldn't be harmed. Arjuna said he saw only the eye of the wooden bird kept on top of the tree.

The root of Yoga, namely Yuj, refers to this alignment, this focus. Those who seek shall verily find what they are seeking. For example, we want wealth but our actions don't align with our goal. Shri Bhagawan Uvacha is the Infinite continuously communicating to us. We need to align ourselves in our speech, actions, emotions, beliefs and thoughts.

**Loke Asmin**
Instead of saying Asmin Loke, Krishna says Loke Asmin. There is a deep reason for this. Arjuna is self-centered and has been talking about his problem continuously. Krishna mentions "loke" or "in the world" to remind him that the problem he is facing is nothing when you consider the entire universe. After that, Krishna says Asmin because the problem at hand must still be solved and it is in this world or environment.

**Sadhana of Loke**
Do the Totality View when confronted with a challenge. I am in the room. The room is in a house. The house is in the city. The city is in the state. The state is in the country. The country is in the Earth. Earth is in the galaxy. Even the sun which is so big for us is only a speck in the universe. My problem is likewise nothing when taking the Totality View.

In response to a Sadhak's question, the Master said that when you observe your gross and subtle expressions, you need to be objectively aware (like when you observe another person with mental distance) rather than judging yourself and becoming self-conscious. How do you know you are being objectively aware? When you note it as a negative quality or negative action rather than as a negative person.
