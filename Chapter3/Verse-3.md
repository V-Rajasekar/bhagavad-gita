The Supreme Lord said: In this world, there is a two-fold path as stated by me earlier O sinless one; Yoga of knowledge for saankhyas and yoga of action for yogis.

**Shri Bhagavan Uvacha**
The Infinite is communicating to us always. Whether we call it God or Nature or by some other name, we recognize that there is a higher power. The Guru Shakti which is an aspect of the Infinite is always communicating to us and guiding us. We just have to attune to it. Speech is just one form of communication. If we fortify our vessel and become a Supatra, the wisdom will flow into it.

**Sadhana homework**
For 2-3 minutes daily after Sadhana, `chant Shri Bhagavan Uvacha` to yourself and as you chant think of the Infinite; I am the Jivatma or individual soul opening up to the Infinite with ultimate devotion and surrender. Chant for about five times and just be silent each time.

[`Sep 25, 2022 Part 2`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HqtCIooYvTw)

**Shri Bhagawan Uvacha**
This represents the Guru Tattva and the Guru Shakti within us that is always teaching us. The six qualities of Bhagawan: Power, Dharma (righteousness), Shri (abundance), Gnyana (wisdom), Vairagya (detachment) and one more.

As we start attaining parts of these six qualities, recognize that this is the Infinite manifesting and it's actually not me. Do the same anytime anything good happens to me. Watch out for the ego which is always waiting to trade on the spiritual powers, like it did with Ravana and Hiranyakashipu. Anytime anything good happens to me, think and feel "Shri Bhagawan Uvacha".

Shri Hanuman's surrender to Rama was so complete, that his utterance of Shri Rama saved him from the very arrows of Rama.

When Arjuna was speaking, he had actually made some mild accusations against Krishna. Krishna's reply was classic. He ignores the accusations and just gets to the point "In this world, there are two kinds of people ...". That's because has absolutely no ego and only unconditional love.

**Sadhana Tip**
Do not personalize it.
The other person is personalizing it when they insult you. The best way to counter is to actually not be affected. Do not personalize it. This is an internal attitude. You still need to take the correct action.

When Shishupala insulted Krishna numerous times in Yudhishtira's Raja Suya Yagna, Krishna was calm while others got very angry. Krishna killed (liberated) Shishupala only after 100 insults following a vow he had previously made to Shishupala's mother.

During Yoga Sankirtan Sadhana, go with the flow and do deep breathing when impressions are released. Do not be impatient. The impresssions have been accumulated over thousands of births.

Arjuna Uvacha is the individual soul (me) seeking and Bhagawan Uvacha is the Infinite responding. The Infinite responds to those who truly seek. You need to be aligned in speech, action, emotions and thoughts in your seeking. Arjuna was supremely focused as shown in the following incident before his Acharya and other students. Drona kept a wooden bird on a tree and asked his archery students to shoot the eye. First he asked each of them what they saw. Duryodhana saw the people and the land, others saw the tree and the leaves, Bheema saw the apples hanging from the tree and Yudhishtira saw a fledgling nest in the tree that shouldn't be harmed. Arjuna said he saw only the eye of the wooden bird kept on top of the tree.

The root of Yoga, namely Yuj, refers to this alignment, this focus. Those who seek shall verily find what they are seeking. For example, we want wealth but our actions don't align with our goal. Shri Bhagawan Uvacha is the Infinite continuously communicating to us. We need to align ourselves in our speech, actions, emotions, beliefs and thoughts.

**Loke Asmin**
Instead of saying Asmin Loke, Krishna says Loke Asmin. There is a deep reason for this. Arjuna is self-centered and has been talking about his problem continuously. Krishna mentions "loke" or "in the world" to remind him that the problem he is facing is nothing when you consider the entire universe. After that, Krishna says Asmin because the problem at hand must still be solved and it is in this world or environment.

**Sadhana of Loke**
Do the Totality View when confronted with a challenge. I am in the room. The room is in a house. The house is in the city. The city is in the state. The state is in the country. The country is in the Earth. Earth is in the galaxy. Even the sun which is so big for us is only a speck in the universe. My problem is likewise nothing when taking the Totality View.

In response to a Sadhak's question, the Master said that when you observe your gross and subtle expressions, you need to be objectively aware (like when you observe another person with mental distance) rather than judging yourself and becoming self-conscious. How do you know you are being objectively aware? When you note it as a negative quality or negative action rather than as a negative person.

Lord Krishna changes roles smoothly and perfectly as any Master does. Arjuna has seen him only as a friend all his life, and in the first chapter just complains about his circumstances without seeking guidance. So Krishna also is quiet and gives him healing. He is referred to with simple names like Madhava. Krishna or any Master will not impose spiritual power on others. From the second and third chapter onwards, Arjuna starts seeking. Krishna is then referred to as Shri Bhagawan, one who is one with Bhagavath, the Infinite, as he has changed roles. He is giving guidance to Arjuna as a Guru, bringing in light where there is ignorance. 

Bhagawan Uvacha - It is the Infinite that is speaking to us through Krishna

Sadhana tips:

Transition between roles in life completely like Krishna does as observed  by Narada in the Shrimad Bhagawatam.

Practice Lokesmin 
When facing a challenge first think of loke the entire universe and how I am not even a speck in it. Then think of asmin and bring myself to the current problem at hand. Neither extreme is right, I need to balance between the two.

[`Oct 16, 2022 Part 5`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkyLhjJbCmQ&t=3601s)

**Loke** indicates all possible worlds, the entire universe, all dimensions.

Each of us identify with up to a particular extent of "Loke". That's where I am stuck and my goal should be to progress to the next extent. From myself to my family to my family and friends to city to country to humanity to all creatures including animals and plants to the galaxy to the entire universe. Arjuna identified so much with his family that he saw all the opponents only as family members on the battlefield. I think I am stuck on name and fame.

In the context of dimensions, there are numerous (thirteen or so) Loke. For example, patala loka to bhuloka to devaloka ("heaven") to siddha loka (of yogis) to the Infinite. These are not geographical places but experiences within myself.

Think loke but, at the same time, think asmin or now. This is Karma Yoga in a nutshell. Identify with the entire humanity and universe but act in the present.  Identify with the entire humanity, this results in unconditional love. Then take the action needed currently. Identifying with the totality and expanding our consciousness melts our ego. Then there is no "I". Who is doing the action then? The actions flow automatically from the higher - Shri Bhagawan Uvacha.To the outside world, it will appear as if the person is doing the action. Lord Krishna was the perfect embodiment of this. He practiced Loka Sangraha and also masterminded a world war to establish righteousness. 

Looking at each word in the beginning of the verse in order again: Shri Bhagawan is the Infinite. Uvacha is the expression of the Infinite. Loke is the expression of the Infinite resulting in all worlds. Asmin is the expression of the Infinite as the individual, me, here and now. Nishta is the path to reverse the process and get back to the Infinite. Dwividha means two-fold. The path to the Infinite is only one, the expansion of consciousness or Sankhya. The path is two-fold, it has two elements.The path is inward, not outward.

Mere intellectual understanding of the scriptures is no use. You are spiritually growing only if you are expanding and uplifting the consciousness through the grace of the Guru Shakti, otherwise external knowledge is no use. The Master gave the story of a scholar who approached a saint and showed him some scriptures and asked him to explain those to him. The saint kept quiet for a while. The scholar asked, "When will you explain?". The saint said, "I just did". The scholar didn't understand and said, "Please speak and explain".  The saint said, "I will try". He could only try because this cannot be expressed in words.  The saint started speaking and within a few words went off into deep meditation. This happened five times. Then the scholar gave up and went away. The saint's disciples asked him what happened. He replied that the "scholar" couldn't attune to the divine frequency but that the seed had been sown in him for true spiritual growth at some time in this birth or future births.

We are responsible for continuing the regularity of our Sadhana. The Guru Shakti will take care of increasing the quality of the Sadhana if we do that.

***Pura proktha"**
The simple meaning is "spoken earlier" but actually Pura means ancient, for example, puranas. The strategy of using the word "Pura" is employed because the mind gives more value to ancient things. For example, saints are venerated after they leave their body. The Master said he is aware of many saints and yogis who were completely unknown. Lord Krishna isn't referring to the fact that he gave this wisdom to Arjuna in the previous chapter. He is referring to previous births. In one such birth, he gave the wisdom as the Sage Narayana to the Sage Nara. We have all heard these truths in our previous births. It isn't a coincidence that we are getting the yogic truths of the Bhagavad Gita revealed to us now. Because of the intensity of the Sadhana, few get into it and of those, many don't sustain it. Lord Krishna is speaking to Arjuna. Lord Krishna is speaking to me. The Master is speaking to me.

In general, the path is to perform actions that expand the consciousness.

**Anagha** means pure or sinless one. Lord Krishna addresses Arjuna with such unconditional love.

In response to a Sadhak's question to registering a young child for the empowerment session, the Master said the actions of the parents are related to the Karma of their child. Children have an open aura. This is more clearly obvious when the child is in the womb. But this is also true after birth as the child is under the protection of the parents. What we do affects the Karma of our child. 

[`Oct 23, 2022 verse 3 Part 6`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5A6S4VJaXBg)

**Uvacha** stands for the entire expression of Divinity Shri Bhagawan and not just what Lord Krishna says.  A Sanskrit pandit who had memorized the entire Gita and was teaching it to others for many years asked the Master - "Why is it we don't know or delve into these deeper truths of the Gita?" Because we are caught up with the beauty of the Sanskrit language itself or with the mere intellectual meaning or with the overall story itself. Just as we could get stuck on a magnificent entrance to a palace with beautifully carved pillars etc. and not go into the palace itself.

The Infinite expresses itself through the entire macrocosm and all the lokas (dimensions) and I am one such expression. Because of Maya, I am not aware of this connection. The Nishta is the path to connect back to the Infinite.

**Pura proktha**
One meaning of is that Krishna had expounded this wisdom to Arjuna in the previous birth when they were Narayana and Nara. But actually the Infinite has been conveying this to me through my multiple births. The words addressed by Krishna to Arjuna are the words addressed by the Infinite to me.

**Anagha**
I am pure. Everything you believe to be a fault, you have acquired and can be removed through Sadhana. Lord Krishna is expressing the highest form of healing energy, namely, unconditional love. The Master said - "You can send me a long email with all your faults and yet that won't convince me that you are impure!".

The true wonder of the world is that the Infinite is expressed in every second in every part of the world and yet we don't recognize the Infinite.

**Nishta**
This is not an external path. It is an internal condition or position. My current condition is that I feel that I am separate from the Infinite. This internal condition changes with Sadhana and the grace of the Guru Shakti. A student approached a Zen Master who was drawing water from a well and asked him what he was doing before he became enlightened. The Master said that he was drawing water from the well and pouring it in the vessel. The student asked him what he did after becoming enlightened. The Master said that he was drawing water from the well and pouring it in the vessel! Externally a spiritually advanced person would be similar to another person. The difference is that the person functions with attachment while the Master functions with detachment.

**Gnyana Yogena Sankhyanam Karma Yogena Yoginam**
This refers to how there is an absorptive capacity within us and the execution capacity within us. Everything in life is done in two stages - We first absorb the principle (gnyana yogena sankhyanam) and then apply it in action (karma yogena yoginam). For example, in the context of Bhakti Yoga, we absorb the principle of deep love and then express the love. In the context of Karma Yoga, we first absorb the principles of effective action and then apply them in action. For good relationships, we first absorb the principles of good relationship and then apply them.

If you aim to be a Master, you will never become one!  Aim to become a powerful Sadhak.

[`Oct 30, 2022 verse 3 Part 7`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sy4qfmcbe54)

**Pura Proktha**
Not only does this refer to Lord Krishna having mentioned this to Arjuna in the previous chapter and not only does this refer to Lord Krishna expounded this as Sage Narayana to Arjuna as Sage Nara in a previous birth, but it also refers to the Infinite speaking to all of us through various masters who have attuned themselves to the Infinite. Because the wisdom is finite, a finite person can't convey it to us. Instead it is the Infinite that communicates the wisdom through a Sthitha Pragnya as a medium. The Guru Tattva and Guru Shakti convey the wisdom through anybody who has attuned themselves to the Infinite, whether it is Krishna, Rama, Buddha or Christ.

**Anagha**
This reflects the unconditional love which any Yogi or Master has towards anybody. The Master narrated a lovely incident when he was in the Himalayas. He saw a venerable Siddha who was giving healing energy to all non-stop even when sick or sleeping. The Master sent healing energy to the Siddha so the Siddha's body would last longer so he could continue to heal others for longer. The Siddha asked, "Why are putting an obstacle to my efforts? I go off into deep meditation when you send the healing energy!" The Master suggested that since this thought had been put into the Master's mind by the Infinite, how about if the Siddha received the healing and redirected it to others. The venerable Siddha said that was a good suggestion. The interesting part of this was that the disciples of the Siddha who were continuously with him were oblivious that the Siddha gave healing even when "sleeping" or how Yogishri could have interacted with the Siddha when they hadn't met and talked. This shows that physical proximity to the Guru doesn't necessarily result in spiritual growth.  It is attuning to the Guru Shakti.

**Nishta**
Nishta is an internal position or condition, not an external path. It depends on where you position yourself - at the body, prana, emotions, thoughts, wisdom body, individual soul or infinite? That's your condition. Self-expansion is the goal.

**Gnyana yogena sankhyanam karma yogena yoginam**
Sankhyanam and Yoginam don't refer to different types of people but two attributes within us. Gnaya yoga is the yoga of wisdom that unites us with the Infinite when we invoke the energy of Sankhya or absorptive capacity. Karma yoga is the yoga of action, that unites us with the Infinite when we act. Mere knowledge without action is no use. Action without wisdom is no use either. 
- Don't run away from challenges, instead act
- Act after having gained knowledge
- Act with detachment and complete experiences
- Learn from these experiences and get wisdom

Nishta also means Bhakti, devotion or faith. Faith is the starting point to absorb knowledge and practice anything; even for scientists, faith is the starting point. Rabindranath Tagore said, "Faith is the bird that feels the light and sings even when the dawn is still dark".

The Guru Tattva is one aspect of the Infinite. The Guru Tattva manifests as the Guru Shakti. The Guru Shakti manifests in certain circumstances in the form of a Guru. Surrender to the Guru Shakti enables reception of the wisdom.

All words, emotions, thoughts and actions have vibrations and energy. The form we associate with a god or goddess is the grossified form of the particular energy. A mantra has energy. Om Ganapathaye namaha! Salutations to the Energy of Success. The Puranas have subtle messages in their stories. Sati was the ansh avatar of Parvati. She wanted to marry Shiva. Sage Diksha wouldn't allow that. Sati immolated herself. Shiva invoked the energy of anger and transferred it to a strand of his hair which he threw down and it became Bhadra.

When Arjuna later says it is impossible to control the mind, Lord Krishna doesn't resist the energy. This wisdom is at a very advanced level and we are well below kindergarten level and still the Master is patient with us, like Krishna is patient with Arjuna even though it's like a kindergarten student is saying a Ph.D. is wrong on the topic. Instead Krishna says, "What you're saying is true, Arjuna, but with practice and Sadhana, the mind can be controlled". Krishna goes with the flow of Arjuna's energy and then conveys the wisdom.

[`Nov 6, 2022 verse 3 Part 8`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xb-0gUwyHqQ&t=10s)

Sankhyas and Yogis do not refer to two types of people, rather the two complementary aspects within us. Sankhya refers to the contemplative aspect within us and Yogi here refers to the active aspect of us. In this inner world, there is a two-fold path. Absorb the higher principles (gnyana yoga) through contemplation and practice the principles (karma yoga) through action. This principle is applicable to all yogas.

Loke asmin = Inner world
As we journey in this inner world towards self-purification, self-development and self-realization, the great yogis and siddhas provided the essential principles and ways to practice. Since we have five dimensions to our personality, they provided these principles and practice methods in the form of five yogas:
Karma yoga related to the physical body
Hata yoga related to the Prana
Bhakti yoga related to the emotions
Gnyana yoga related to the intellect
Dhyana yoga for the bliss sheath

All of these are required just as if a room has five portions, cleaning one portion alone while keeping others untidy doesn't clean the room.

There are different permutations and combinations of these five yogas that could result in other types like mantra yoga. Any master emphasizes what is important to a Sadhak at a particular time. Krishna himself focuses on giving guidance on 3 forms of yoga: 
Bhakti yoga or meaning of unconditional love to the gopis
Karma yoga or how to act to Arjuna
Gnyana yoga to Uddhava in the Uddhav gita
So in this case, hata yoga is folded in with karma yoga, and dhyana yoga is associated with all of them. Buddha would also give a different answer depending on what is needed by the student.

Sadhana of Nishta

- It is internal condition or position. Expand internally.

- Faith. Everything we do in the world is based on faith. We have faith that when we breathe out, we will breathe back in. That when we go to sleep, we will get up. We have faith in the people around us - family, friends, employees, boss. Similarly have faith in the spiritual sadhana. If I do the Sadhana diligently and practice Nishta, Absorption and Practice, I will achieve my goal.

-Fixing goal
My spiritual goal is self-purification and self-improvement. The absolute spiritual goal is to merge with the Infinite. Focus on goal.

-Shraddha (consistent)
Be steadfast. The scriptures say that with Shraddha Bhakti Dhyana, one could reach the Infinite.
Instead of digging a 2-foot well in 100 places, one 100-foot well in the right spot will give you results. The difference between an achiever and non-achiever is that the achiever is steadfast and consistent in efforts while the non-achiever puts in effort in a haphazard way.

- Suffering
Accept the short-term suffering to achieve the long-term goal. For example, doing exercise.

-Excellence
Improve the quality of what you do compared to others.  By the way, comparing to others is a major block for excellence. If you do an activity, do with perfection. Otherwise don't do the activity at all. Bring in enthusiasm and vigor to your activity.
-Conclusion
Stay with it till the end. Complete tasks to the end.

-Death
Continue till my ego dies.

If I practice these three - Nishta, Absorb higher principles and Practice them, I will certainly achieve any goal. I don't have to worry about how to get the higher grace etc. Just focus on Nishta, Absoring principles and Practice, everything else will come automatically.
