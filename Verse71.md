In verse 70, Lord Krishna was referring to the internal state of a Sthitha Pragnya. Now he is talking about how a Sthitha Pragnya acts in the world.

The Kama mentioned in Verse 71 by Lord Krishna is the uncontrolled desire. Charathi is moving or acting. The significance of Charathi with Shanthi is to break the misconception within me that action or effort leads to loss of peace  Instead of thinking external object, person, activities reduce my internal peace, think strong peace within me influences the outside world. 

It is through the sadhanas, doing yoga, exercise, and resolving the unresolved action one can be peaceful internally. 

How much you are in peace when your interacting in the world ? It depends on how much your doing the sadhana, the yoga sangithan, the yoga, exercise, but its very very important how are you interacting in the world the (practicality).Right now you wull have some challenges in your life, may be its in the work, relationship your mind thinks if these challenges aren't there then you will feel happy. It will try to escape from that challenges, task.If you are suppose to finish a task and itsn't finished in time then you won't be peaceful first complete the item to be peaceful.

When ever you have unfinished job then that will ruin your peaceful of the mind. How to tackle this unfinised job? Not by escaping from the challenges, but rather acting on the challenges.

**How to conqure the fear? Do the things that are fearful to you.**

In this verse and several other times in Chapter 2, Lord Krishna uses the combination `"yaha" and "saha" `or `"yasya" and "thasya".` *Whoever does the things mentioned, that person will become a Sthitha Pragnya. We strongly believe that only some divine people can become enlightened. This is due to our conditioning in this life and previous births. Yogishri gave the story of a tiger cub which had been brought up by deer and kept thinking it was one of them. When a tiger came to hunt all the deer, this tiger ran with the rest of the deer. The hunting tiger caught this tiger and took it to a pond and showed their images and said "Look, we are the same. You are a tiger". We are like the tiger thinking we are a deer due to all of our impressions and conditioning.

**_Jan 2, 2022_**
The ancient wisdom gives equal importance to both the internal and external worlds. Internal application of the principles help us in purification while external application helps us to live our life fully.

The situations we experience are what are needed for us to work out our karmas and grow spiritually. So we should not leave the world and shirk our responsibilities.

We have to balance these 2 facets of our life. Should neither ignore the external worldly life nor get lost in it. This is the path to move from a kaama kaami to Sthitapragnya.


**That person who having abandoned all desires moves without craving, without a sense of mineness or ego, attains peace .**

If we step back for a minute from deep within the verse and look at the Gita overall, we can see that when expounding to Arjuna and, in reality, to all of us, Lord Krishna continually weaves the two equally important applications of the ancient wisdom - internal transformation and purifying external action. It's not enough if we learn how to drive a car in a street with no traffic (personal Sadhana when we are by ourselves), we need to learn to do so in a crowded street with traffic (i.e., our external actions). Later, Arjuna asks Krishna "Thadekam Vada", "Tell me one thing" - Should I learn the wisdom or should I act? Krishna doesn't give a simple answer because of the nature of the question. If somebody asked you to give a simple response to Should I inhale or Should I exhale, you will say both are important and depending on the situation or particular instant you have to inhale or exhale.

The Yaha Saha and Yasta thasya combinations are used regularly in the Gita.  Last week, the Master explained how it is symbolic of the fact that anyone (he who does certain things) can become a Sthitha Pragnya and that this transformation isn't restricted to those from a specific religion, caste, creed, culture, country etc. Today the Master revealed the hidden secret in between the two words yaha and saha . Bhavana alone isn't sufficient, the corresponding action is required. In fact, bhavana which isn't followed by action isn't true bhavana. When we are hungry, don't we eat? Do we come up with some excuse and not eat? 

`"yaha" and "saha" ` Even a person who committed most sinful, but if he decided to change and purify himself and attain enlightment. Here the bhavana, or intense, and action is more important. You have to be discipline, punctual in your sadhana to become good at anything. Its the union between the intension and action.If you want to chang something in your life then you have change the pattern, the thinking and action because these are the things that does the change.

We are creating our life every day through our bhavana, emotions, thoughts and actions (namely my energy field) which lead to certain outcomes. So if we want to change the outcome, don't we have to change our bhavana and actions? If we want a good relationship, not only do we need the Bhavana of unconditional love but have to follow up with action of kind words and deeds.

*When having a positive Bhavana, don't stop with that and implement it through action.
Likewise, purify the Bhavana while performing activities
The Bhavana and Action need to be in sync*

If I am delaying my Sadhana, e.g., not watching the Gita discourse at same time every week, this act of delaying will lead to delays in other aspects of my life. That's the energy field I am creating.

In response to a Sadhak's question about how can the soul be purified when it is already pure, Yogishri reminded us not to mix spiritual levels. From the absolute level, the Paramatma, the infinite soul, is pure. From the relative level, the Jivatma, the individual soul has got impressions. Suppose we are in a dream wherein Yogishri tells us it's all an illusion. Now in the dream, we are chased by a tiger and we call Yogishri on the cell phone. He tells us to climb any nearby tree. At that time, it is pointless for us to say everything is a dream because if so we won't be affected by the tiger chasing us. For the dreamer, the tiger clawing and the pain is very real, so the Master gives us the solution for that. So we shouldn't mix up levels. The highest truth is for inspiration while the Sadhana tips are for daily transformation.

**Sadhana homework:**
Examine specific aspects of my life with problems and see if the Bhavana and action are in sync.

Sadhana what is my intension ? what are my actions? If your action is not insync with your intension then your not following this principle `yaha and saha`

If you don't follow this principle you either become a dreamer or blamer.Neither you should be a dreamer nor a complianer be realistic(be in present).

**_Jan09_2022__**

The Master continued to reveal the yogic secrets in verse 71 of chapter 2 in the context of the  principle of Yaha and Saha.
 The cause is needed for the effect.

**Our Bhavana and Karma need to be in sync to achieve our goal.** If someone has only the Bhavana but does not put in the corresponding action, that person becomes a dreamer only. If someone does actions mechanically without the right Bhavana, that person becomes a complainer.
 The actions won't be synchronized with the person's goal. Examine the aspects of your life and see which extreme you are in each aspect.

Spirituality is not against wealth or abundance. In fact, this is considered as Goddess Lakshmi. The Master gave the wonderful story of Adi Shankara who upon getting a nellikkai from a lady who had nothing,  chanted the Kanakadara Stotram which showered her with wealth.
 Goddess Lakshmi represents not only external wealth but also inner wealth, the peace.

To have a desired effect, the appropriate qualifications are required. That person who fits certain criteria and performs certain actions evolves to become a Sthitha Pragnya. The mind craves the effect without focusing on the cause. Both Bhavana and Karma together make up the cause (karana) for which the effect is the fruit that is deserved and desired. You get not merely what you desire but what you deserve; you need to be qualified to get the fru*you need to be qualified to get the fruit*. If both Bhavana and Karma are there, nothing in the world can stop you.

Some words of verse 71 refer to Bhavana and some words refer to Karma. Without craving, without the sense of mineness and without ego refer to Bhavana. Abandoning (uncontrolled) desires and "moving" relate to Karma. Sarvan (all) is related to both Bhavana and Karma.

Since "Puman" (root Pumsaha) is used here, some might mistakenly take it to refer to only male. It is used here because a male is talAking to a male but is actually indicative of human kind. When Krishna talks to the gopis in the Bhagavatam about how to give unconditional love, the word for "female" is used there. But in both these cases, the word used is indicative of the wonderful qualities and infinite potential of human beings in general.

There are four dimensions of "Puman". First a male or female who functions mechanically. Then going beyond male or female to a human being who exerts the power to choose every moment things (and also emotions and thoughts!!) which don't agitate us and which give us long-term peace. Only human beings have the power of choice. 
The third aspect of Puman choosing to expand one's consciousness to merge with the infinite soul, the Paramatma. The way to do this is to diligently follow what the Guru says and perform Sadhana. A Master is one who is not stuck at the consciousness of body, prana, emotions or thoughts but has expanded the consciousness to merge with the Paramatma. 
The fourth aspect of Puman is having the spirit of being a servant, one who serves humanity. A yogi is connected with the Infinite in meditation and when functioning in the world sees everybody as a manifestation of that Infinite and therefore has Seva bhavana towards all. The classic example of this is Lord Krishna who washed the feet of guests at the Rajasuya yagna, and arranged the slippers of guests during the celebration after the Mahabharatha war. It was not his action that matters but his attitude, the Seva bhav.


In response to a question on whether a place's culture can be an obstacle to yoga, the Master said choose the positive aspects of every culture, for example the spirit of open-mindedness and hard work in the US.

**_Jan16,2022_**

The word Puman , or for that matter any other word in the scriptures, is by itself not what is significant. It is actually the underlying principle and the depth that is expressed using this word. This is also true of our expressions in general. What matters is not our words and actions per se (for example wishing someone a happy new year) but having the underlying emotion and feeling behind it. This underlying Bhavana is what gives power to our words and actions.

The first dimension of Puman is to function mechanically as a man or woman. The second dimension is to function as a Human Being, exerting the power to choose the positive rather than functioning mechanically. This includes choosing how we express ourselves - our actions, speech and facial expressions, with Bhavana. People respond to the underlying Bhavana not the external expression. Ask your spouse or someone near to you for feedback on your expressions. What I truly express to the world comes back to me.

The third dimension of Puman is our potential to expand our consciousness and merge with the soul or the Infinite within us. When we recognize that the Infinite is within us, we also realize that it the Infinite is also there in Nature and all creatures. This is what Jesus meant when he said that the Kingdom of Heaven is within us.
 When Buddha said, Look within. 

The fourth dimension of Puman is "Servant", thinking of and acting for Loka Sangraha, the welfare of others, with attitude of service, not helping (which may have ego with it). Do your duties with Seva Bhav, for example at work, thinking of the welfare of the company and of the clients.
 If we have less ego, we will serve others more as we see God in all. Conversely, if we serve others, that dissolves our ego. Have Shuddha Bhavana, a pure attitude. A yogi is like a new-born child, no manipulations or pretense. 

Sarvan refers to an uncompromising attitude on both the quality and quantity of everything we do. The mind has a tendency to compromise, to jump from place to place and also within the same place (chanchala). Quantity here refers to completing every aspect through Shraddha, the effort to finish completely. It doesn't matter whether others see it or not because how we do it affects our attitude and outcome.
  My focus should be not on external recognition but to have an uncompromising approach in quality and on completing what I start. Complete your conversations.

Any great achiever in any field would be practicing the Sadhana of Sarvan in that field, whether they call it that or not. Whatever actions they do, they will finish them fully, and their actions put together result in the outcome they have. Similarly, they will act with passion and sincerity, with quality. They will give their heart and soul into whatever they are doing. These two qualities can help me achieve whatever goal I fix. This will make me a powerful person, materialize my goals.
 
Charathi and Sarvan together represent a person moving about in the world and living life in a full way. This is a true spiritual person. Right from childhood, we have been fed this wrong idea that a spiritual person is one who gives up. There were a few yogis who choose to be away for the purpose of research and healing like a scientist who isolates in a laboratory. This is not required for everyone though. A spiritually developed person moves about in the world fully and has an uncompromising attitude in both quality and quantity.

Lord Krishna values Peace as the highest outcome because that is the highest goal of all human beings. But when you get Peace, you get everything below that also.

Close your eyes and imagine a spiritually developed person. Your first thought will be a recluse. In reality, this is a person fully functioning in the world (some may self-isolate for research and healing). Sage Sukhamuni had some ego that his father was the great sage Veda Vyasa. So when he asked his father for spiritual guidance, Vyasa asked him to get it from King Janaka instead. This was a big eye opener for Sukhamuni who had thought Janaka was material and that instead his own position was more exalted.

In response to a question on how to determine if our bhavana is fully pure and if we have completely surrendered to the Guru Shakti, the Master said, "Follow the principle of Bhagawan Dattatreya  - Be a Nitya Sishya". The goal is Infinite and the path is also Infinite, so we should not aim for completion but for continuous improvement. The Master also explained that the very act of asking such a question itself shows that the bhavana is pure.

Sadhana Tips

Sarvan : Identify the roles you play in life. In those roles, what are my actions? Start practicing Sarvan in those actions. As a parent, once you have decided to spend time with your kid, spend quality time. Also, spend the time fully with him. Let quality and quantity be the highest.

Sarvan : Make a list of unfinished tasks and one by one start completing them. As you complete, strike them off by hand. This gives a tremendous sense of fulfilment even if the task is small. You will train your mind to go to the end of something. That ability to complete something you have started is Shraddha.

Charathi : Visualize a spiritually developed person who moves about in the world and who has an uncompromising attitude in both quality and quantity and giving the best in everything, what kind of impact that person will have.

**_Jan 23, 2022_**
Yaha and Saha are indicative of the qualifications required to not only become a Sthitha Pragnya with infinite peace (Shanthi) but also for worldly success.

The power of Puman is the power to choose. At the lowest level of development, we are not even choosing our actions. They are generated automatically without our awareness or they're triggered in response to an external factor. Our speech is an impulsive reaction to external stimulus, for example an insult. As a Puman , we can tap our inner power to choose our actions and our speech. Our emotions usually arise automatically or in response to some external input. With Sadhana, when we tap the inner power to choose our emotions, we control our emotions which makes us very powerful. With more advanced spiritual practice, the power to even choose our thoughts is opened up within us.

Sarvan is the uncompromising attitude to put in the necessary quantity and quality. Then nothing can prevent you from achieving your goal. What is the block we face from implementing "Sarvan"? It is Tamas, which is ignorance and laziness. The Master can guide us but can't put in the effort for us. Yogishri gave the example of a young cricket aspirant who had come to him for advice. The youth said none of his coaches taught him the subtlety of how to swing the ball but instead only asked him to get up in the morning and do his jogging and exercise. The Master explained that first the Tamas has to be overcome, then Rajas, only then the subtleties of Satva can be taught. So in the beginning, the Master may be stern with the student (to remove the Tamas) and then gentle, and then very subtle.

Complete your experiences to grow spiritually.

The first dimension of Charathi is to graze, consume  - to enjoy. A Yogi enjoys every aspect of his or her life. This is not indulging in certain activities more than others but enjoying everything completely. The mind tends to postpone enjoyment. If we value one activity (for example, interacting with my kid) more than another, then we actually will not be able to enjoy the first activity fully. Enjoy doing the activity as much as the outcome itself. "Kashtapattu seiadhe, Ishtapattu sei"! Since we have to do it, we might as well enjoy it. So don't think of it as "hard work" results in enjoyable outcome, but the enjoyable cause results in enjoyable effect.

The second dimension of `Charathi is to improve one's skills by practicing, performing and observing.` Identify your Swadharma, your unique talents. This is not hard. We fundamentally know what it is or we can figure it out by writing. Practice the skill when you're alone, perform it in the world and learn by observing other experts in that area. Arjuna is the classic example of this which was why we has the best in the world at archery and was adored by his Acharya Drona. The Master gave the wonderful example of how Bhima taught Arjuna how to eat with all five senses and how it's possible even to eat and enjoy in the dark. Always willing to learn and improve his skill, Arjuna learned how to apply this concept to archery so that he could shoot perfectly even in the dark at a target which made a noise.

In response to a question from a Sadhak about feeling guilty when he imagined images of somebody dirtying near a temple, the Master said this was due to impressions formed when observing someone else. Take any external action if possible at the time and recognize what is beyond your control. Doing Sadhana and deep breathing will release the impression.

In response to a question, the Master also expounded on how women continue to be spiritual even during the menstrual cycle. Since they go through pain during this time, it was advised to take some rest, but any activity, including spiritual, can be done.

**_Jan 30, 2022_**

We tend to fall into one of two extremes. Either we are too harsh on ourselves because we don't perform a certain Sadhana properly.This is due to a feeling of guilt when we judge ourselves. Alternatively, we skip doing the Sadhana (e.g. exercise) sometimes  because there is no short term disbenefit and we are not aware of the long term impact of skipping it. In fact, the mind will always gravitate towards something that it's sure will give a positive benefit. The key here is to remember that spiritual evolution is a gradual process and 100% perfection is only given as an ideal so there is a goal in mind. Stay in the middle.

Living a full life means to complete all your experiences with awareness without creating new impressions and by releasing prior impressions, to progress towards the path of merging with the Infinite.

So the `first dimension of Charathi, namely enjoying, means to experience every emotion but not store the impression.` Even Rama cried on hearing about the away of his father. If it is a strong negative emotion, feel the emotion and connect with the Guru Shakti and breathe in through the nose and breathe out through the mouth to release it. Also you can truly enjoy an experience only when you are not caught up with it. Don't suppress emotions or on the other hand be indulgent. Spirituality is not boredom. Spirituality is enjoyment.

`The second dimension of Charathi is to practice, perform and observe.` Doing this converts talent to skill. The block for practicing and performing is tamas. The block for observing is the ego. We have to accept we don't know in order to learn. This does not diminish the respect others have for us, in fact it enhances it. Be like a child without any ego who is continuously observing and learning. Be straightforward.

`The third dimension of Charathi is to initiate action and to respond. `The block in responding is that we didn't do it properly in our first attempt at a response. The Sadhana tip is to look at the various aspects of our life and see if I am initiating action or a series of actions keeping in mind my goals and how I am responding to situations and people. Don't be a complainer. As a Puman, we have the power to choose.

`The fourth dimension is to be engaged, to be busy and productive. `Yogis are always busy and productive. Fulfill your duties and do things that are productive to you and to the world, for loka sangraha. The Sadhana tip is to check how I'm spending the 24 hours in a day.

`Charathi also means to roam - to rest and relax.` This should be practiced only after you have practiced the above four dimensions of Charathi, otherwise it would lead to tamas. When we do practice the other dimensions of Charathi, rest is needed. Rest automatically happens in the beginning of a meditation session. 

`Charathi also means to continue to be - to not get toppled by a development, whether sorrow or challenge or even extreme joy`. We can do this through Purushartha and Sadhana. With regular Sadhana, we come back to a stable state faster. 

Whatever Lord Krishna conveys in the second chapter, he then expounds in detail in the subsequent chapters of the Bhagavad Gita. For example, he tells Arjuna in the fourth chapter, "You have been through many many births".

In response to a question, Yogishri explained that the yogic path is the only path to the Infinite, whatever you may call it. Brahma vicharanam is required at the same as doing duties is required at the same time because that gives a higher goal to our actions, otherwise you are stuck. Karma yoga, Bhakti Yoga and Gnyana Yoga are all to be applied to expand one's consciousness and merge with God. One has to apply whatever is required at a given stage. It is like if you are travelling on a road towards a destination and the road becomes narrow, you should switch from driving a car to a bicycle.

The first four dimensions of Charathi are about action while the fifth and sixth are about attitude. The fifth and sixth are meaningless unless you practice the first four. Also, one should not practice only one dimension to the exclusion of others. It is okay to be inspired by one more than others. 

The fifth dimension is to roam, to relax. The sixth is to "continue", to not be toppled. People committing suicide is an extreme step, but this results from a series of smaller such steps of letting go and not facing the challenge and continuing. Not persevering even in small things is considered spiritual suicide.

We should strive to be in a state of balance between the Action and Rest dimensions of Charathi. 

All of us are born with spiritual tamas. We overcome this spiritual tamas through Purushartha or the power of choice. How do we know we are in a state of spiritual tamas? Check if you are in one two extreme states: We are only in action without any rest. Or only in rest and giving justification without any action.

Leading a full life means following the principles of Charathi. Being a human being is an amazing thing. Lord Krishna refers to the wisdom later as Raja Vidya, the royal knowledge. "You are on the Royal path", said Yogishri.

As we go about our lives every day we get drained of energy, not only physical energy but also mentally. This verse contains secrets revealed by the yogis on how to, in fact, reverse the process and increase our energy using `Nisprihaha`.

`Nisprihaha` means you act without craving. `Sprihaha` or craving is the extreme version of desire powered by a strong force. It is similar to Thrishna. Kama degenerates to Sprihaha. Craving is extreme longing or a yearning for a thing or a person, for example, my child. I am unhappy without it and even when I get it am worried because of fear of losing it. Two signs of craving a thing are: (i) we are agitated without and with it, and (ii) we show a destructive tendency (e.g., gossiping) related to that thing

Devas are the positive energy or tendencies within you and asura is the negative tendencies within us and who wins depending on who is fed more. Ravana lost all the benefit of his spiritual tapas because of his craving for Sita and was provoked by Surpanaka. Diridrashtra had craving for his kingdom and his son. Duryodhana had a craving for his power. Karna had a craving for name and fame. Yudhishtira had a craving for the dice but then he got over it.

`Part 10 Feb 27,2022`
The Master noted that an adult has never asked this question. It is the ego that makes us not be straightforward and prevents us from asking a direct question. Be straightforward and solution-oriented. Be like a child - innocent and pure.

A Sadhak may get disillusioned or feel guilty when not achieving inner transformation. At that time, just recognize that the delay in transformation is due to the absorption principle.

The first dimension of `Sprihaha is craving`. Craving is evident when the mind is agitated with or without something and when we have a destructive tendency about something. Another indication of craving is when I have unrealistic expectations. This causes stress which leads to loss of peace. To pinpoint this, work backwards. When we are stressed, see what unrealistic expectations we have. Align our expectations with the realities of the world. This will lead to peace within us. When Yudhisthara was asked what's the biggest surprise in the world, he said it was the fact despite seeing that everyone who is born in the world dies, a person believes he will be immortal or at least not die for a long time to come. A lady came to Buddha with the body of her dead son and asked him to bring him back to life. Buddha said he can do it but asked her to first get some mustard seeds from the house of any family that hasn't experienced death. After visiting several houses, the Lady came back and said she no longer had the request. Her unrealistic expectation went away.

The second dimension of `Sprihaha is envy`. The hidden aspect of `this dimension of Sprihaha is arrogance or feeling superior to somebody else`. When we look at somebody, we immediately compare and then feel either jealous or arrogant. Both are Sprihaha. They are two sides of the same coin, so if we pick one up, the other comes along. In fact, the mind may play a trick and bring in the jealousy through our arrogance. What has another person got to do with how we feel?

If we don't water the Sprihaha, it will wither away. How to not water the Sprihaha? Don't encourage it and don't suppress it. Suppression is like a spring which can come up with force after compression. What to do instead? Be aware of the emotion. Connect with the Guru Shakti and request help. Breathe through nose and out through mouth. Focusing on the breathing keeps us distanced us from the emotion so we can look at it objectively. This is a great method devised by the Yogis. For a strong negative emotion, bring about an intention to release it at the beginning of the next Yoga Sankirtan Sadhana.

`Nirahankara means without the ego and Nirmama is without sense of mineness`. Aham here is the conditioned or finite I and not the aham in aham Brahmasmi. Mama is Sanskrit possessive form of "aham". So the aham leads to mama. Ego refers to not only feeling superior but also feeling inferior, anything related to being centered around myself.

`Part 11 Mar 6, 2022`

prihaha literally means envy. But it also refers to arrogance. Envy and arrogance are unnatural qualities that arise because I compare myself with others. Naturality is our true state. Being natural is being undisturbed. If we are completely natural, we merge with the Infinite. The more artificial we are, the farther we move away from the Infinite. If an intoxicated person offers us 1 million, we will tell him, let's talk tomorrow. That's because we realize he isn't his natural self now. If we have nice car but don't live near anyone, there would be no envy or arrogance. Hence these unnatural qualities arise from comparison with others. Craving or jealousy or arrogance aren't natural qualities. We have acquired those because of conditioning over long time. Just like an iron piece that is covered by dirt doesn't respond to a magnet, we are in artificial state when we are conditioned. 

`Nisprihaha` is being without envy or arrogance. It is good to be inspired by somebody better than us in something and want to acquire the good quality they have. Likewise, if you see somebody with less, we can be grateful for what we have and see how we can serve that person. So the Sadhana tip is Don't Compare. Appeal to the Higher.

Nirahankara - The entire wisdom of the scriptures is in this word.

Aham is I. When Aham expands, we merge with the Infinite. When the "I" is conditioned by physical body, by the mind and its emotions, and by the intellect, it produces the ego. Ahankara is the feeling that the I is the doer. Brahmakara is recognizing that the Brahman is the doer.

The mind plays tricks on us by thinking: "I" am going to become self-realized. The "I" has to go first.

The Master gave a wonderful story from the Yoga Vashishta where a Queen who is a Sthitha Pragnya goes about her duties as a queen without any fuss and without anyone including the king knowing that she was self-realized. The king has a deep quest to learn more about purifying himself and renounces everything and sets out to the forest. The queen meets him there in disguise as a yogi and explains to him that even though he thinks he has renounced everything, he hasn't left his ego as he still has the sense of I. The yogi gives him a series of empowerments resulting in his enlightenment. The queen quietly goes back to the palace. The the king realizes that what he needed to renounce was his ego and not the kingdom and goes back and serves as king. A true Sanyasi is not one who renounces the world but renounces the ego. That's why it's impossible to identify who a Sthitha Pragnya is from merely external actions.

Ahankara is the feeling that the I is the doer. People mistakenly assume that being spiritual means the "kara" (actions) should stop, so they retain the Aham and leave out the Kara. The purpose of Charathi is to act fully in the world and complete our experiences.

Nirahankara should be understood as "Nir Aham" kara.  Remove the feeling of Aham and continue to work. 

Do without being the doer. Focus on the action rather than on the doer. This incidentally also makes you more productive.

Those who focus on getting a spritual image don't do their duties and instead focus on doing something different from the norm, and are considered "gurus". A true Master is natural and focuses on quality not quantity. Adi Shankara had only about 14 disciples. His teachings became famous because he received instructions to spread this ancient wisdom and hence traveled far and wide.

The Nirahankara Sadhana tip provided by Yogishri is to objectively observe how my life is centered around the I.




`Part 12 Mar 13, 2022`

I need to develop the Bhavana of seeking guidance from the Higher with true humility. The ego is an obstacle to developing the Bhavana to dissolving the ego.

Dissolving the ego means expanding the Aham to merge with the Infinite.

The first dimension of Kara is doer: Be a doer without a sense of doership.

Another meaning of Kara is Lord. Our true consciousness can be the Lord or the "conditioned I" can become the Lord and we become the slave.

Another dimension of Kara is determination. When Kara is associated with the ego then it becomes stubbornness - a reluctance to remove the negative despite advice from others. Ravana got guidance from his wife and his brothers and was still stubborn.

Lord Krishna had no ego when he went to his Guru Sandeepani and was able to learn the 64 Sciences in 64 days.

The Sadhana tip is to observe the play of the ego in everything we "receive" and do (act, speak, feel and think). Do this like a game and don't look for solutions.

One should not have the intention to kill. Unintentionally hurting organisms need not cause guilt.

If you intentionally did something wrong then at the end of the next Yoga Sankirtan, ask forgiveness from the person in your mind and convey unconditional love.

` 20 Mar 2022`

`Nirahankaraha` – the state of No EGO is the ultimate goal in life!  Every sadhana practice- yoga sankirtan, Sunday sessions, any other sadhana tip given are all aimed at achieving this ultimate goal of Nirhankaraha.

Sadhana can give us both worldly benefits and spiritual evolution. If our ego dominates our personality then the benefits would be restricted to external, worldly benefits as in the case of Ravana – a great devotee of Shiva, who had done extensive tapas and Sadhana but had attained only the worldly benefits – in terms of wealth, power etc, but not evolved spiritually. 

Functioning with or without ego refers to the internal attitude with which every action is performed.  All activities that are performed with the conditioned I as the centre are Ego centric activities, the Aham centred activities.

All activities that are performed with the Infinite as the centre are the activities that are not egocentric, without the claim of doership, it is a state of no ego.It is not possible for us to directly step into a state of No ego, the I in us is conditioned by the body, the emotions and thoughts. Very gradually, through consistent Sadhana, this conditioned I has to expand and reach the state of no conditioning to become one with the Infinite. 

Karaha- refers to Lord- If the ego is the Lord then we become a slave to the ego, all our thoughts and actions will be egocentric.  One of the symptoms to find out if our ego is dominating our personality is to check whether we are obsessed by the desire to control others.  Kamsa and Hiranyakasubu are typical examples of being slaves to their egos.  When Kamsa/ Ego rules our personality, we experience a great deal of stress and tension, whereas when the Ego is reduced and Krishna rules, we experience the sweetness- (Mathuram) of peace and happiness.
Karaha also refers to stubbornness. When ego dominates, there is a lot of stubbornness, refusing to change the negative and choosing the right path. Eg Ravana. But as one progresses spiritually, this stubbornness is used as an advantage, it becomes determination.   Determination gives the power to be consistent in one’s effort to evolve spiritually.

Karaha also means power or strength.  When Aham or Ego dominates, one gains power externally. In spirituality, power or strength refers to the gain of inner power and inner strength.  Prahalada points out that Hiranyakasibu had a lot of external wealth and power but he was bereft of the inner wealth -  of peace and happiness. Duryodhana chose the world’s most powerful army battalion offered by Krishna, (External power) only to lose to Arjuna who chose plain Krishna who would not even wield any weapon in the war.  Krishna, helped Arjuna realize his Inner strength- the strength that comes from connecting with the Infinite.

Karaha also means a heap of snow.  Snow is soft and pure a state that is similar to the state of a person who is attuned to the Brahman in him.  The same snow could become a cover of the Infinite Self within, when one is attuned to the I centred Ego.  As we expand our consciousness this cover of snow can be removed and the mountain that lies under, which is the Infinite would be revealed and its power will manifest in all areas of one’s life.

The meaning of giving up the ego seems simple,  i.e., be humble.  But Nirahankara is actually the following.

The true I or consciousness is conditioned by the physical body, the mind with the emotions and intellect with its thoughts. Together this produces the ego. "Niraham" is expanding the consciousness which removes this conditioning while still doing "Kara" or actions.

Humility and gratitude are prescribed as Sadhana so that the ego does not corrupt us as we progress and others praise us. This is why true Yogis do not show their powers.

We might have the fear about what will happen if we are not associated with the body, mind or thoughts. This is similar to a dreamer when told about the Waker.

To attain the state of Brahmakaraka I have to drop off my ego, emotions, thoughts when we ask what is good? you say not being bad, so they both are intertwingled that is also a limit, but the state of brahmakaraka is beyond the limit. As the dreamer cannot realize the waker as long as he is in dream, similarly you cannot be brahmakaraha you cannot persive the god as long as you
use the finite instruments the body, mind and thoughts, then with what equipments one can realize the god is only by expanding the I, consciousness. 

The Master gave a beautiful way to treat Sanskrit grammar as Sadhana.
Aham comes from Sanskrit root Asmath and refers to the subject or the individual soul. Maam (to me), maya (by me), mahyam (to me), math (from me), mama (mine), mayi (in me) are all declensions of the root word but also indicate how we are more and more fixated on the I. 

`Mama` refers to the sense of ownership and is the most extreme of these as we become slave to an external object. Have possessions and enjoy them but don't become a slave to them. Yudhishtira was a master at this. His conch was called Anantavijaya because he was never unhappy at losing something, even his kingdom, because he didn't have the sense of ownership, so he was always a winner.

The Sadhana of `*Nirmamaha"` is to be a guest in this world not an owner, just like you are a guest in your friend's house and enjoy everything but know it's not yours. The fear of death is due to fear of the unknown and fear of losing what we have - possessions, family, friends. So whenever you have stress, work backwards, you have the sense of ownership of an object. Become a user instead. In general, if you don't have the feeling of ownership and think like a user, then there is no feeling of loss, no failure. Everything belongs to the Higher. Nirmamaha doesn't mean giving up your possessions, it means treating them as something to be used temporarily.

The Sadhana tip is to recall that you are using objects in life rather than owning them, while still performing your obligatory duties with those objects.

The principles in Verse 71 are sacred principles, divine principles!  Soak yourself in the principles of Nisprihaha , Nirahankara and Nirmamaha and thus practice Satsang to progress to the Infinite! The meaning of Satsang as the association with good people is just one facet of Satsang. In reality, Satsang is the association with anything that is divine and uplifting including, in particular, these divine principles. Adi Shankara said associate with Govinda! Our consciousness is uplifted due to the Sunday discourse and then drops due to what we see, read and hear during the week. So be aware of what you inputs you are getting. Negative emotions increase the ego. Daily Yoga Sankirtan Sadhana raises the consciousness. Watch 5-10 minutes of the Gita discourse every now and then to again get that upliftment. 

A salt is concentrated when by itself but dissolves when associated with water. Our ego is like the salt and these divine principle are like the water. If we merely intellectually examine this and say "Yes, the ego or salt is here and the water is there and mixing the two will dissolve the salt", we will not progress spiritually. Instead, let yourself be soaked in the divine principles and consciousness will expand and the ego will dissolve. Usually you are inspired by one or two principles, for example, the Nirmama principle of "you are the user and not the owner". Reflect on the principle you are inspired by. 

It is not the I who is progressing to the Infinite but these divine principles that dissolve my ego.

The ego is produced from the I that has been conditioned by the body, mind and intellect and puts forth negative energy as it grows. The ego develops many branches. One cannot just cut off the ego, so clip its branches, for example false humility or spiritual superiority, as they grow.

All spiritual practice has the ultimate goal of Nirahankara. For example in bhakti yoga you bow down with palms pressed against each other or touching the right palm to the heart area. In Jnana yoga you always surrender to the guru first. In Hata yoga you use the Vishnu mudra alternate nostril breathing where the finger position is similar to the blowing the conch. This cuts off the ego at the very beginning because it reminds us of the fact that Vishnu uses the Conch to breathe Prana to the entire universe including to the embryo as expounded by Sage Kapila to his mother in the Kapila Gita.

The possessiveness dimension of Nirmama is more extreme than the dimension of the sense of ownership because you are also affecting somebody else. Also, any type of possessiveness causes slavery which results in stress to both me and the other person.

True spirituality is being completely free. This was expounded and demonstrated by Swami Rama Thirtha when he visited the U.S. in early 1900s.

Sadhana tip for Nirmama: See who you are possessive about.

Muruga's killing of Soorapadman repeatedly is symbolic of defeating the ego through infinite patience.

The ego will place blocks in doing your spiritual practice. Follow "Guror vakhyam param dharmam".

Understanding the principle/fundamentals is more important while doing an activity. All titans in their area understand the fundamentals and followed the 
steps to be a successful person in their fields. Nirahankara (Without Ego) and Nirmamaha (Without possession) are the two pillars of all sadhana and to develop in the spirituality.

Every yoga practice is also associated with fundamental principles. The fundamental principles behind practice never change and they have existed for a long time. The practice related to sadana when combined with the fundamental principles of spirituality makes it meaningful. In jnyana yoga, the depth becomes essential and not breath of knowledge. Similarly, in bakthi yoga bavana becomes essential. Mechanical performance of sadana without understanding basic principles lead to stunted spiritual growth or no growth at all. 

Possessiveness lead to control of other because of mamakaram(Its mine, she/he mine). The Egos can be of the following types:
1. `Thamasic` means ignorance/darkness/laziness/ extreme stubbornness[unwillingness to change the negative quality]. When expressions of ego become highly pronounced and unmanageable mamakaraha becomes extreme asura’s quality becomes active within you. 

Harms anyone to get what they want; goodness completely buried..vindictive nature.unwilling to take guidance because of the insecurity and fear of changing conquer the asura within you to evolve in spirituality. 

2. `Rajasick` means stubborn in their belief, actions. passion/workaholic/stressed/pride..ego here was called `rakshasas` as highly stressed and in a state of confusion. They may be righteous normally but to achieve what they want they may resort to unrighteousness too. May or maynot take guidance..eg.Ravana
   
3. `Sathvik` are amenable to spiritual. Relative goodness/ relative purity..called deva and devi…ego well under control, and you are righteous , gravitates towards positive things in life..and at least ensures you don't devolve in spirituality. ..surrenders and takes guidance to evolve as you value spirituality. One Day you have to transcend and go beyond satvik ego, by doing sadhna, become a sthita pragnya.
