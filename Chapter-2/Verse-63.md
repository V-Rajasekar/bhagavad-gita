An anger is only an example. Its only one of the modification so somebody who is not short temper, they might have someother modifications like (Fear). 

`bhavati` means arising and becoming (you become one with anger). This is a dangerous stage. Any emotions whether its good or bad as long as its under your control its fine. when it gets out of your control then it becomes dangerous. 

A good emotions like helping others. First earn wealth and increase your capacity to  give money to others. Never exhaust your capacity (e.g) If you have Rs 10, 000 don't give away all the 10,000 because you have exhausted your capacity your no longer in a position to help others.
Instead invest the money and increase your capacity and continuously help others.

An family person should split his earned money in to four parts. 
1. To fullfill his responsibilities and fullfill there dependents needs
2. Saving for future.
3. To enjoy at present
4. A little position to charity and for spiritual journey. May be 10-11%


 मोह is comprised of 6 dimensions(or diseases) of self-deterioration:-  
   
1. Loss of awareness: Awareness is spiritualty and moha is lack of awareness. 
Example: The case of the alcholic who felt that he was still himself even after consuming several pegs. A video recording by his wife of his own behaviour showed him his altered state. Use (abuse) of addictive substances always lead to lack of awareness since they are intoxicants by nature. They shrink one's aura.

2. Delusion: This is the word that has also been used in the translation of the verse. Delusion is disconnection from reality. 
Example: A person might be spooked witnessing the shadow of another person who is standing behind, say, a pillar and not in the line of sight of the first person. The first person perceives the moving shadow of the other person as a ghost when he/she is in a state of delusion. That person is consumed by irrational fear.
As one's consciousness rises, she rises above delusion. Arjuna, here, is also in a state of delusion. In the first chapter, he is appalled to even think of committing the heinous crime of killing wicked people. Krishna through his healing energy and wisdom raises Arjuna from his delusion by the end of the Bhagavad Gita.

3. Ignorance: This is an extension of delusion where the person lacks the wisdom of life. Example: A person believing in superstitions or a wealthy person mistaking people's respect for his clothes and riches as their respect for him. People tend to believe that a 'spiritual' person with a large following is bound to be a true yogi while in stark contrast, the Upanishadic masters hardly had any students.

4. Infatuation: The disease of constantly overrating a person or object.  
Example: A boy infatuated with a girl will be blind to the faults in her. True love is when a person corrects his partner when she is wrong. The fanatical "fans" of celebrities who tend to mimic the celebrity's lifestyle are also in a state of infatuation. Wealth is another classic example of a source of infatuation.

5. Lack of decision making skills: The mind of a person in a state of moha is clouded by delusion. Consequently, such a person lacks the clarity to take the right decisions. It is better to take the counsel of wise people while taking big decisions in life.

6. Pain: A person plagued by moha is in a state of great mental agony. He is so acclimatized to it that he just does not realize it which is a very dangerous state. The master tries to shake the person out of that pain because that person makes no effort to come out of it. 

Anecdote: A 'saint' walking out of a river after having a bath is accidentally touched by a person of a lower caste. The saint is enraged and tells him that he has to take a bath again because of the transfer of the other person's impurity. The lower caste man tells him that he had already taken a bath and thus he is not impure. But the saint points out to him that the impurity arises from this caste and even beats him for it. When all his anger is exhausted, he realises his actions and goes on to take another bath. As he comes out of the river, he finds the other man also coming out of the river. The man explains that he was beaten by a person lower than the lowest caste as the reason for his taking a bath. He makes the saint understand that anger had possessed him and that he had no awareness of himself when he was giving a beating. The 'saint' finally falls at the feet of the true saint.

Buddha was compassionate to the entire humanity because he could understand the states of moha everyone was in. 

Another story that Yogishri said last year that comes to me in this context (it was said in a different context though): When Buddha was giving a discourse to his disciples one day, a stranger came up to him, cursed him and spat in his face. The Buddha remained calm and did not react. All his disciples were furious at that man. The next day, the same man again showed up and this time begged for the Buddha's forgiveness. The Buddha asked whom he should forgive and explained to him that the person who spat on his face the previous day was someone else (someone possessed by anger) while the person asking for forgiveness is someone entirely different.
