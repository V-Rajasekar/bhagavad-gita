The Supreme Lord said: In this world, there is a two-fold path as stated by me earlier O sinless one; Yoga of knowledge for saankhyas and yoga of action for yogis.

**Shri Bhagavan Uvacha**
The Infinite is communicating to us always. Whether we call it God or Nature or by some other name, we recognize that there is a higher power. The Guru Shakti which is an aspect of the Infinite is always communicating to us and guiding us. We just have to attune to it. Speech is just one form of communication. If we fortify our vessel and become a Supatra, the wisdom will flow into it.

**Sadhana homework**
For 2-3 minutes daily after Sadhana, `chant Shri Bhagavan Uvacha` to yourself and as you chant think of the Infinite; I am the Jivatma or individual soul opening up to the Infinite with ultimate devotion and surrender. Chant for about five times and just be silent each time.

**Shri Bhagawan Uvacha**
This represents the Guru Tattva and the Guru Shakti within us that is always teaching us. The six qualities of Bhagawan: Power, Dharma (righteousness), Shri (abundance), Gnyana (wisdom), Vairagya (detachment) and one more.

As we start attaining parts of these six qualities, recognize that this is the Infinite manifesting and it's actually not me. Do the same anytime anything good happens to me. Watch out for the ego which is always waiting to trade on the spiritual powers, like it did with Ravana and Hiranyakashipu. Anytime anything good happens to me, think and feel "Shri Bhagawan Uvacha".

Shri Hanuman's surrender to Rama was so complete, that his utterance of Shri Rama saved him from the very arrows of Rama.

When Arjuna was speaking, he had actually made some mild accusations against Krishna. Krishna's reply was classic. He ignores the accusations and just gets to the point "In this world, there are two kinds of people ...". That's because has absolutely no ego and only unconditional love.

**Sadhana Tip**
Do not personalize it.
The other person is personalizing it when they insult you. The best way to counter is to actually not be affected. Do not personalize it. This is an internal attitude. You still need to take the correct action.

When Shishupala insulted Krishna numerous times in Yudhishtira's Raja Suya Yagna, Krishna was calm while others got very angry. Krishna killed (liberated) Shishupala only after 100 insults following a vow he had previously made to Shishupala's mother.

During Yoga Sankirtan Sadhana, go with the flow and do deep breathing when impressions are released. Do not be impatient. The impresssions have been accumulated over thousands of births.

Arjuna Uvacha is the individual soul (me) seeking and Bhagawan Uvacha is the Infinite responding. The Infinite responds to those who truly seek. You need to be aligned in speech, action, emotions and thoughts in your seeking. Arjuna was supremely focused as shown in the following incident before his Acharya and other students. Drona kept a wooden bird on a tree and asked his archery students to shoot the eye. First he asked each of them what they saw. Duryodhana saw the people and the land, others saw the tree and the leaves, Bheema saw the apples hanging from the tree and Yudhishtira saw a fledgling nest in the tree that shouldn't be harmed. Arjuna said he saw only the eye of the wooden bird kept on top of the tree.

The root of Yoga, namely Yuj, refers to this alignment, this focus. Those who seek shall verily find what they are seeking. For example, we want wealth but our actions don't align with our goal. Shri Bhagawan Uvacha is the Infinite continuously communicating to us. We need to align ourselves in our speech, actions, emotions, beliefs and thoughts.

**Loke Asmin**
Instead of saying Asmin Loke, Krishna says Loke Asmin. There is a deep reason for this. Arjuna is self-centered and has been talking about his problem continuously. Krishna mentions "loke" or "in the world" to remind him that the problem he is facing is nothing when you consider the entire universe. After that, Krishna says Asmin because the problem at hand must still be solved and it is in this world or environment.

**Sadhana of Loke**
Do the Totality View when confronted with a challenge. I am in the room. The room is in a house. The house is in the city. The city is in the state. The state is in the country. The country is in the Earth. Earth is in the galaxy. Even the sun which is so big for us is only a speck in the universe. My problem is likewise nothing when taking the Totality View.

In response to a Sadhak's question, the Master said that when you observe your gross and subtle expressions, you need to be objectively aware (like when you observe another person with mental distance) rather than judging yourself and becoming self-conscious. How do you know you are being objectively aware? When you note it as a negative quality or negative action rather than as a negative person.

Lord Krishna changes roles smoothly and perfectly as any Master does. Arjuna has seen him only as a friend all his life, and in the first chapter just complains about his circumstances without seeking guidance. So Krishna also is quiet and gives him healing. He is referred to with simple names like Madhava. Krishna or any Master will not impose spiritual power on others. From the second and third chapter onwards, Arjuna starts seeking. Krishna is then referred to as Shri Bhagawan, one who is one with Bhagavath, the Infinite, as he has changed roles. He is giving guidance to Arjuna as a Guru, bringing in light where there is ignorance. 

Bhagawan Uvacha - It is the Infinite that is speaking to us through Krishna

Sadhana tips:

Transition between roles in life completely like Krishna does as observed  by Narada in the Shrimad Bhagawatam.

Practice Lokesmin 
When facing a challenge first think of loke the entire universe and how I am not even a speck in it. Then think of asmin and bring myself to the current problem at hand. Neither extreme is right, I need to balance between the two.

[`Oct 16, 2022 Part 5`](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MkyLhjJbCmQ&t=3601s)

**Loke** indicates all possible worlds, the entire universe, all dimensions.

Each of us identify with up to a particular extent of "Loke". That's where I am stuck and my goal should be to progress to the next extent. From myself to my family to my family and friends to city to country to humanity to all creatures including animals and plants to the galaxy to the entire universe. Arjuna identified so much with his family that he saw all the opponents only as family members on the battlefield. I think I am stuck on name and fame.

In the context of dimensions, there are numerous (thirteen or so) Loke. For example, patala loka to bhuloka to devaloka ("heaven") to siddha loka (of yogis) to the Infinite. These are not geographical places but experiences within myself.

Think loke but, at the same time, think asmin or now. This is Karma Yoga in a nutshell. Identify with the entire humanity and universe but act in the present.  Identify with the entire humanity, this results in unconditional love. Then take the action needed currently. Identifying with the totality and expanding our consciousness melts our ego. Then there is no "I". Who is doing the action then? The actions flow automatically from the higher - Shri Bhagawan Uvacha.To the outside world, it will appear as if the person is doing the action. Lord Krishna was the perfect embodiment of this. He practiced Loka Sangraha and also masterminded a world war to establish righteousness. 

Looking at each word in the beginning of the verse in order again: Shri Bhagawan is the Infinite. Uvacha is the expression of the Infinite. Loke is the expression of the Infinite resulting in all worlds. Asmin is the expression of the Infinite as the individual, me, here and now. Nishta is the path to reverse the process and get back to the Infinite. Dwividha means two-fold. The path to the Infinite is only one, the expansion of consciousness or Sankhya. The path is two-fold, it has two elements.The path is inward, not outward.

Mere intellectual understanding of the scriptures is no use. You are spiritually growing only if you are expanding and uplifting the consciousness through the grace of the Guru Shakti, otherwise external knowledge is no use. The Master gave the story of a scholar who approached a saint and showed him some scriptures and asked him to explain those to him. The saint kept quiet for a while. The scholar asked, "When will you explain?". The saint said, "I just did". The scholar didn't understand and said, "Please speak and explain".  The saint said, "I will try". He could only try because this cannot be expressed in words.  The saint started speaking and within a few words went off into deep meditation. This happened five times. Then the scholar gave up and went away. The saint's disciples asked him what happened. He replied that the "scholar" couldn't attune to the divine frequency but that the seed had been sown in him for true spiritual growth at some time in this birth or future births.

We are responsible for continuing the regularity of our Sadhana. The Guru Shakti will take care of increasing the quality of the Sadhana if we do that.

***Pura proktha"**
The simple meaning is "spoken earlier" but actually Pura means ancient, for example, puranas. The strategy of using the word "Pura" is employed because the mind gives more value to ancient things. For example, saints are venerated after they leave their body. The Master said he is aware of many saints and yogis who were completely unknown. Lord Krishna isn't referring to the fact that he gave this wisdom to Arjuna in the previous chapter. He is referring to previous births. In one such birth, he gave the wisdom as the Sage Narayana to the Sage Nara. We have all heard these truths in our previous births. It isn't a coincidence that we are getting the yogic truths of the Bhagavad Gita revealed to us now. Because of the intensity of the Sadhana, few get into it and of those, many don't sustain it. Lord Krishna is speaking to Arjuna. Lord Krishna is speaking to me. The Master is speaking to me.

In general, the path is to perform actions that expand the consciousness.

**Anagha** means pure or sinless one. Lord Krishna addresses Arjuna with such unconditional love.

In response to a Sadhak's question to registering a young child for the empowerment session, the Master said the actions of the parents are related to the Karma of their child. Children have an open aura. This is more clearly obvious when the child is in the womb. But this is also true after birth as the child is under the protection of the parents. What we do affects the Karma of our child.
