#### PART 1 by Yogishri - 2nd May 2021

```
indriyāṇāṁ hi charatāṁ yan mano ’nuvidhīyate
tadasya harati prajñāṁ vāyur nāvam ivāmbhasi

The mind which follows the roving senses,
indeed carries away the wisdom like the wind(carriers away)
a boat on water.
```
He has taken a long journey that is the ladder of fall, and finally he comes to the stita pragnia the pragna aspect and how the whole things robs your wisdom. 
In your life your thoughts, your thinking should be very well organized and focused. It is only a person who is focused can achieve anything in life.

Many factors will try to pull you away from your goal. By doing the sadhana and being discipline you can achieve your goal. Don't get in to the illusion, know your purpose know your goal and take necessary action to achieve it. Once Naratha asked lord vishnu what is maya? Vishnu took him to a desert and told i will answer to your question but before i answer to your question, I'm feeling thirsty can you get me a glass of water. 
Naratha went in search of water in the desert, Vishu created a beautiful city by illusion there naradha met a beautiful girl and marrier that girl, they gave birth to many child and lived their for many years, after some years Naradha had some problem in life, and he said to god why are you give me so much of problem?
Vishnu appeared to Naradha thats all fine, but where is the glass of water i asked you ? Naradha remember why he came to this place? Similarly don't bogdown with the issue which pulls you away from reaching your goal. 

When your sense center aren't in control your sense organs (eyes, ears, tongue, skin, nose) will wander for sense objects. If your sense center aren't in control then the mind won't be in control. when your mind, your thoughts and thinking aren't focused your entire wisom will be carried away. 

The name Govinda has different dimensions, Govinda means one who control the cow herads. The cow grace with out a control, and doesn't follow a direction, so govinda control the cows and direct them. Here cows are the senses, control your sense(center) organs to control the mind. 

Think about how much time you send in the social platforms, watching TV. Your living a mechanicl life without knowing the purpose of your life (eg) you work from the morning to the evening without knowing why are you working? Finding your purpose of life is a life long quest? First start with the absolute level, life a happy life, have best of best things in your life.

In this verse krishna connects all the previous verses together first he talks about the pragna(wisdom), and then he practically talks about the senses then a deep analysis how the mind goes out of your control. In this ladder of fall there is also the solution of bhavana, practising sadhana to come out of the fall. we also talked about how you should be organised and structured in your life but how to be orhanised and structured ? If you look the ant they run helder skelder but if you put a sugar bit they all form a line and approach the sugar bit in a discipline way. In similar way today there are various emotions various thoughts running in different direction. what is the sweet here is the purpose of life, and the purpose of life is happiness. You experiment many things in your life to experience the happiness. Right from the start of childhood experimenting with toys, later with relationship, name and fame. 
if you want your mind to be disciplined and structured forcing will not work. The more you force more will be resistence for a while. First of all you need to find your goal and there will be enough factors to distract you from achieving the goal. Once you understand the purpose of the life all your emotition, thoughts, actions will be towards the goal.

`indriyāṇāṁ hi charatāṁ` The senses are roving(moving) let us take the site you have the sense object which is the eye(sense organ) and then the optical nerve which is the gross aspect, and then the sense center which is the outer most layer its a layer between the organ and the mind. when you see an object it should be register in the sense center then your perception will be completed. Eventhough the object register in the rectina (organ) but if its not registered in the sense center you will not be recognize it.
How to master over indriyanam ni charatam ? When you experience something be focused and experience fully it could be something like eating your faviourt food  bring all your energy and expereince that and then after the expereince is over don't sit and lingering on that experience move to the next experience.
`yan mano ’nuvidhīyate` The person who has no control over the sense will not have control over his own mind. When the senses controls you it will start controlling the mind the mind will not even pause for a second but it will simply follow the sense objects. When the mind is carried away the emotions is also carried away which is a dangerous situation. 

When a person is in emotion(e.g) sorrow, depression, anger any amount of advise will not pull him out of the emotion. Its only through the pradnya(wisdom) that person can be pulled from that emotion. When Arjuna was not ready to battle in the battlefield Krishna didn't say anything but simply smiled and preached what is right and wrong? He basically expanded the pradnya aspect within Arjuna gave the wisdom.

`The way we act right now is the sense objects(Mobile, TV) carries away the sense organs(eye) and the sense center carries  away the mind, that carries away the emotion, which is a dangerous situation and that may lead to destroying the whole wisdom.
What we have to do is reverse the process First expand the pradnya(Wisdom) aspect which will pull the emotion, mind when the mind in control it can pull back the sense center, which intern stop the sense objects carrying away the sense organs`.

`Law of cause and effect` Our scripture are written based on the principle of connection (eg) if you are not united you won't have buddhi, if you dont have buddhi, you don't have bhavana, and if you don't have that he will not have peace and happiness. This is called law of cause and effect, law of karma and it is based on the principle of connection and interconnection. How one leads to another?
    
A person who understand the principle of connection he will be successful in all the activity he do.There is a chain reaction if you have an issue in one area of your life will affected the another area of the life. (e.g) If your boss shout at the office, and you expose your anger to your spouse, and child the confident level of the child will go down.

Every word and action of you radiate a particular type of energy and its affect you and others.
`prajñāṁ vāyur nāvam ivāmbhasi` He uses an example the boat is carried away in the water by the wind. Here the boat is you the pradnya aspect within you and the water is your life and the wind is your emotion. In your life there will be ups and down and various challenges and oppurtunity. Not only the wind can carry away the boat from its choosen path but it can also topple.

Andrea del sarto the famous artists who lossed his fame because of the deep love emotition with his girl friend. One emotition is enough to move you away from your goal and topple.

`Sadhana` what is the first thing you need to do to achieve your destination? Take the example of rowing the boat sometimes you don't need to row the boat in the downstream, and sometimes you have to row more when going in the upstream. Here rowing is effort Without effort you cannot achieve the destination.
1. `Effort` Hardwork your willing to put in your life.
2. `Right direction` Fix a goal to reach the destination.
3. `Strength` to face the ups and down.
4. `Withstand inner challenges` Ability to withstand the different emotion in your life.

`Law of connection` we have 4 aspect or stages in your life
- First aspect is your gazing with no goals, no questions doing things mechanically. you will start following others. This is called hard instinct like a sheep keep falling from a cliff one after another without understanding why the previous sheep fall? This is a purpose less life. Here is there is no awarness
- Second aspect is connecting unconnected things. Superstituous things connecting causes to unconnected effect(bell ringing is a good sign)
- Third aspect is awaerness there, questioning and connecting causes to the right effect. If something negative happening in your life probe the problem and find the cause for that effect..
- Fourth stage is the stage of contemplating in this stage your able to penetrate deeply find the cause for the effect, but what is the deeper cause? when your in this stage you will be able to go deeper what are the energy your creating? what are the bhavana? what are the karmic block your creating? 
Only when your in the fourth stage your pradnya effect grows day by day. You connect with the divine energy. You become sthitha pragna one who established or connected with the divine.

To be a successful person in any field you need the wisdom for an example take your software carrier you first need the knowledge and then the practical skill to be knowledgable person in that field. Just the books knowledge will not help you to shine you need that practical skill. The `wisdom is the boat` the praknya to sail from the finite aspect to the infinte aspect. When the boat is weak it will sink, so strengthen your pradnya(wisdom) to face the challenges and sail.

There are two types of challenges one is external and another is internal challenges. You will see the ups and downs in life, a life without challenges is not possible to face the challenges the sadhana you do will help to over come the challenges. The `external challenges are like water`, you can see and adjust to those challenges where as the `internal challenges are like wind(vāyur)` that is your emotion. Anywhere your emotion is not under your control it will pull down, but if they are in control and you can convert those emotion into a supportive factor how do you that ? Its only possible when you have a goal in your life, so when you fix your destination very very clearly then what happens is when ever external challenge comes you will see how to over come the challenge and reach the goal. 

The ultimate goal is becoming sita pragnya, now see the relative goals. Take this principal and apply in those areas.let us take your carrier as an example. 
First your boat is the wisdow are you a knowledgeable and skillful person in your carrier ? Ask expert in the field to know about it. 
Is your boat strong ? Do I have a clear cut goal ? Now when this two things are clear then you will get the strength to face the challenges. Do i buckle down when something goes down ? Do I stop the effort immediately? when ever there is an emotion comes do i stop work effectively? Mood swings then the productivity will come down.

Emotions are energy in motion you have to direct your emotion to your goal. First fix a goal in each area (carrier, wealth, relationship). Define a goal and do things to achieve this will indirectly channelize your energy towards those goal. 
Wealth: I want an x amount of money. I want to buy a house.
Relationship: I want to bring my child good in their carrier. I want to keep my mother,partner and others happy.
carrier: I want a progressive carrier learn and develop my skills.
Health: Read about immune system, healthy foods. exercise
