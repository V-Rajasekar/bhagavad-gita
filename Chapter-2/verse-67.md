```
indriyāṇāṁ hi charatāṁ yan mano ’nuvidhīyate
tadasya harati prajñāṁ vāyur nāvam ivāmbhasi

The mind which follows the roving senses,
indeed carries away the wisdom like the wind(carriers away)
a boat on water.
```
He has taken a long journey that is the ladder of fall, and finally he comes to the stita pragnia the pragna aspect and how the whole things robs your wisdom. 
In your life your thoughts, your thinking should be very well organized and focused. It is only a person who is focused can achieve anything in life.

Many factors will try to pull you away from your goal. By doing the sadhana and being discipline you can achieve your goal. Don't get in to the illusion, know your purpose know your goal and take necessary action to achieve it. Once Naratha asked lord vishnu what is maya? Vishnu took him to a desert and told i will answer to your question but before i answer to your question, I'm feeling thirsty can you get me a glass of water. 
Naratha went in search of water in the desert, Vishu created a beautiful city by illusion there naradha met a beautiful girl and marrier that girl, they gave birth to many child and lived their for many years, after some years Naradha had some problem in life, and he said to god why are you give me so much of problem?
Vishnu appeared to Naradha thats all fine, but where is the glass of water i asked you ? Naradha remember why he came to this place? Similarly don't bogdown with the issue which pulls you away from reaching your goal. 

When your sense center aren't in control your sense organs (eyes, ears, tongue, skin, nose) will wander for sense objects. If your sense center aren't in control then the mind won't be in control. when your mind, your thoughts and thinking aren't focused your entire wisom will be carried away. 

The name Govinda has different dimensions, Govinda means one who control the cow herads. The cow grace with out a control, and doesn't follow a direction, so govinda control the cows and direct them. Here cows are the senses, control your sense(center) organs to control the mind. 

Think about how much time you send in the social platforms, watching TV. Your living a mechanicl life without knowing the purpose of your life (eg) you work from the morning to the evening without knowing why are you working? Finding your purpose of life is a life long quest? First start with the absolute level, life a happy life, have best of best things in your life.
