यस्यां जाग्रति भूतानि सा निशा पश्यतो मुने: || 69||

yā niśhā sarva-bhūtānāṁ tasyāṁ jāgarti sanyamī
yasyāṁ jāgrati bhūtāni sā niśhā paśhyato muneḥ

In that which is night for all beings, the self-controlled one is awake.
That in which beings are awake, is night to the sage, who sees

`yā niśhā sarva-bhūtānāṁ ` Night here means that which is unknown to you. When somebody dont know about something they call it Nisha, night, dark.
`tasyāṁ jāgarti sanyamī` that person you practised sanyama (self mastery) he who master right contact to the world, sense objects. This person knows an **unknowable** experience which is unknown to others. Unknowable is different from unknown, unknown can be knowable at some point of time through intellect, but unknowable is something beyond the known and unknown things. 

`vindavar kandeler kandeler vindelar` - He who know does not talk he who talks does not talk. 

`Kadavul meaning kada means ellavatrayum kadanthavan, vul ellavatrilum ullavan.`

Those in avidya they will be in blind darkness and those reveal in vidya(wisdom) they will be in total darkness. The total darkness is the infinite within you.  

who is that person through which he experience that unknown infinite experience ? Usually you experience something through the sense, emotions and thought, but to seek this experience you have to drop your body(sense, emotion and thoughts). Its a dreamer in dream where who don't have any of this tool in the dream world, but through the dream body, emotions and thoughts he can experience in dream world. But using those equipment he can never experience the waker if he wants to experience the waker he has to drop all his dream equipment and wake up and when he wakes now with what equipments 
he experience the waker the answer to this is a dreamer cannot experience only the waker expereince a waker.

You need the body, emotions and thought to experience in the world, but to experience the unknowable one has to self illuminate awake from within.
`jagrat` means the waking state of consciousness. Generally there are 4 state of consciouness they are 
1. deep sleep with no dreams its called `sushupti`
2. Dreams state of consciouness (`swapna`)
3. Waking state of consciouness (`Jagrat`)
4. Deep sleep state of consciousness (`Turiya`)
Jagru here is one who has completely awakend, it is not the waking state of consciouness in this context. Sometimes when your in tired you will be in deep sleep with no dreams its called `sushupti`, and then when you have the dream state(swapna), then when you come to jagru state(waking state) your awaken state you aware of the surronding, but the 4th state turiya state your fully awaken.

`Jagru Sadhana - Fully aware, Mindfulness`
The sadhana here is to go on increasing the awareness, conquer thamas, do things full heartedly. The more you practise the aware, being awake the more chance of getting to the experience of infinite. Jagru means awake also to be watchful, attentive, so everything you do, do it with full awareness.
when your very very watchful you will not eat thing which is harmful to you. The Jagru can bring out the high potential, but the highest potential is becoming a stitapragnya one who is merged with the infinite.

when you expand your consciouness it will be confined to the body, you think your body nothing more, as you become more consciousness then you aware the the breathing, prana, emotions, senses its more than the body, as your consciouness expands you begin to realise the body, the prana, emotions, sense are only the tools to experience in the world in your life. (`Jeevathma`) It is the first milestone you have to achieve to reach the `paramathma` the moment you identify the individual soul `Jeevathma` you will conquer the fear of death.
 
 As a soul your there before your birth and will exist after your death. Your birth and death are limited to the body, but not for the soul after this life you move to another body and carry on the experience in the world until you find your life purpose and the purpose of life is merge with the infinite.

 - Jagru happens gradually through practise. As rama theertha says you can't become Buddha overnight.The sadhana for Jagru is to do the things with ful awarness in a meditative way (mindfulness).
 - Jagru means to foresee, provident means to think about the future and prepare for the future. When your functioning in the present if you life your live fully here today it will help you in the future. You should be watchful in present and a goal in mind for the future.


Train your mind to move from comfort level to uncomfort, that is plung in new experience, you can't be at the same level by doing daily practise on
the unknown area you will get to know the unknown. Don't be thamas being lazy force yourself to overcome the lazyness.

`yasyāṁ jāgrati bhūtāni sā niśhā paśhyato muneḥ` That in which beings are awake, is night to the sage, who sees

When you increase the awareness there is a danger of you getting involved in that, you can totally involved and enmished in the world. When that happens you have to pull yourself to the center. A yogi can penetrate in to others mind and can find the negatvity, and then he knows how to interact with that person. He knows the negativity but he doesn't allowed his mind to affect those negativity.

`Jagrathi(fully awakend)` and `Nisha(ignorant)` are the two extreme side you should always be at the center that is `sathva` a sathvik person well aware of this center and pulls himself back to the center.
