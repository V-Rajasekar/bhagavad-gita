        नास्ति बुद्धिरयुक्तस्य न चायुक्तस्य भावना |
        न चाभावयत: शान्तिरशान्तस्य कुत: सुखम् || 66||

    nāsti buddhir-ayuktasya na chāyuktasya bhāvanā
    na chābhāvayataḥ śhāntir aśhāntasya kutaḥ sukham
  

There is no intellect for the one who is ayukta and for the one who is ayukta that is the one who is not united there is no bhavana for the one who has no bhavana there is no peace. When you don't have peace you cannot enjoy 
anything in the life, you can neither enjoy the world nor the higher. 
```

"An one eye man is the king of blind kingdom" never thing you have achieved so much in life because the achievement you have achieved is negligable when compared to the human potential. Set a higher goal or higher reference point within yourself never set a reference point outside the world like refering or comparing to a person because that will disturbe your mind and you will never be peaceful. 

There is no intellect when you are not doing your action with full bhav (i.e) whole heartedly. if you do things half heartedly you will thing about those issues in those actions and you will never be peaceful if your not peaceful you will never be happy in life.

The key principle in this verse is being yukta (united with one, energy are integrated). To be an yukta you have to gather all your engergy. when your yukta you will become successful in life because your focused. If you are not a yukta you will be a confused person your decision make will be poor.

When your energy is not focused then you won't have the bhavana. The dimensions of `Yukta`
1. `Yukta means united or joined with the spirtual aspect (infinite).` 
  - Practise - Every day reconnect with the infinite by doing meditation (yoga sankithan) it has the positive  energy and vibration.
  - Its not practising the external things(Pooja) is not matter, but being united with the infinite within you. 
  - Connecting with infinite will enhance your consciousness.
2. `Yukta means being arrangement in orderly (Organized).` It is at the intellect level you need to practise your thoughts in a orderly way. If you want clarity  of things you have to organize your thoughts. Whether you are having a conversation or eating food your thoughts will run every where, so get your thoughts organized and structured only pickup those task which help you to accompolish it. By practising organizing your thoughts
    - Your ability to read situation and others mind is developed
    - EOD before go to your bed do a interaspection run through the activities you have done from the morning till night. This will make you aware how organized your in life.
3. `Yukta means being observed intent (focus)` Doing things fully absorbed and focused on anything he do in life.  There are two aspect in this dimension one is the concentration anything you do do it with full concentration the mind will always run after something bring your focus
fully on the work your doing next is the emotions behind it. Be cheerful your emotions should be positive don't be a dry person be cheerful 
do your work as a passion with positive emotions dont thing its a drugggery. When your a cheerful person people like you.
4.  `Yukta means being filled` This is at pranic level at the level of life force energy. The more your are able to back your action with emotion. The more power you'll be able to generate. This creates more impact on yourself and on others. Pickup those things in your life which increase the pranic level the kind og foods, information
5.  `Yukta means being active, being diligant` It means overcoming the tamas and lazyness. Not allowing the laziness get in your system which is following a discipline. 
6.  `Yukta means being very skillfull and being experienced` Each one have unique talent like engineering, art, music. You should put in effort develop the talent and become skillful in that area. Its not only skillful as you 
put more effort you became more experienced. You should go on improving skill, and practise to become experience
and over a period of time you will become the master.

You have to follow all this principles in your life, because its like a chain if one is broken you can't function properly, if your not organized then you won't be able to focus, if you pranic (breathing) is fluent because of emotion you can't focus. 

When it comes to applying this principle on an any given situation you have to choose the dimension of the yuktaga and apply it. There are two goals one in absoulte that is being united with infinite the supreme power.

 Second the relative goal, you have to have relative goal in all aspect of your life like health, relationship, carrier, wealth. `If you don't have a relative goal you will act mechanically without any delibration in life. When you act mechanically then you will go with whatever life is taking you, then you will quickly lose your control over your life your situations, you will start grumbling.`

 First if you want to decide on which aspect should i use in any given situation first fix a reference point and the reference point is goal. Once you have a reference point (goal), next what is the best method to achieve the goal or which dimension to be used to achieve that goal. 

 Let us say your working hard in your office and the stress is too much, so much of task is there and stress is building and your unable to handle the stress, so much of work, so much of task is there to complete it in limited time.
 First ask what is your goal? My goal is i want to complete all these tasks within this given time. what is your level now? My level now is i'm worked up stressed, next ask the question among this dimension which dimension i have to use to reduce the stress.One might be pranic level doing a deep breath to reduce the stress, next organizing the work that is giving a time slot for each task (i.e) from this time to this time i will work on this task.

Bhavana everything you do in your life do with full bhav, means full emotion. Bhav has 3 dimension number one is feeling, second devotion, third is faith. The law is whatever your bhav is that is what your and what ever your is what you get in life. If your positive you get positive things in life. The central thing is bhavana.

When the emotion is directed to the world is called love. when the emotion is direct to the higher is devotion. The more devotion you have you have more faith with faith you can develop so much confident and achieve anything in life.

*When you do things with doubt then that action doesn't have any power.*

what ever your bhavana is that is what your are and your bhavana will determine how high you will rise in life. A person who put their heart and sould in their field they will succeed in that field. 

`Practical principle to apply bhavana`

1.  First of all do all the activity with feeling. Either don't do it or do it with properly.
2.  Work is worship, It's not just the passion but also do it with full devotion. Everything your doing take it as an offering to god.
3.  Faith, start fixing the goal and let it be practical so that you achieve it. Have faith in yourself and the infinite.

`Bhavana means thought,thinking` - We said bhav means atitude which is a combination of your thought and emotion. These thought + emotion give rise to two things one is your atitude and other is the intention.

In every activity your intension should be pure. If not i will put effort to purify the intension.

`Bhavana means observing, meditation` - You need to learn become observative in life. When your lazy your observation will be less. Whenever you get some spare time your mind is immediately is flooded with some negative things happened to you. To avoid this in the spare time observe your actions in your daily day to day 
activities, how your behaving with others. what are the positive things happened to you today ? By remembering the postive things happened to your life you will develop positive energy.


`Bhavana means remembrance` - Once you start developing the observation, then you consciousnesly choose the things you need to remember. Today, the capacity to develop the remembrance is not under your control, you generaly remember the negative things.

Mostly the mind will be picking lot of negative things, but The moment you become alert a keen observer and you realise it is harmful to me and its good for me so you will concisously pick those good things and you will be remember it. 

when every someone does good to you, don't forget in your life time. But when somebody does something wrong to it you forget that in that second. 

How is it even possible? As a humanbeing you have the choice of action, so when ever someone does good thing to you consciuosly bring that gratitude the more feeling you bring you will remember it. Similarly when someone does bad to you do the sadhana and release it during the daily sadhana the more successful doing this execise your bhavana will develop.
  
`Bhavana means zest in live, spark in the live` you should not live a dry live. Observe the babies action in his/her every little thing there is a spark. Where does this spark coming? Its coming from you.The bhavana is something is acquired internally that is inherited from the infinite. Its within you if your want to achieve something in your life, if you have the intension to achieve the goal you will achieve it. 
when your bhavana is so intent no force in the universe can stop you from achieving it. 

`Bhavana means scent, add fragrance` It's not enough if you do something in life but you need to strive to create a value in life in whatever it is that you're doing in life. If your working in a company, or running a business here what value are you creating for the company or the customer. As person mature and goes old you should become more graceful in life.

for the one who has no bhavana there is no peace. For the person without peace how can there be happiness? If your not peaceful then something wrong with you're bhavana. check your bhavana on that area, your relationship with others.

The verses in Bhagavat gita talks about one principle and then talks of the effect of that principle, and then that effect becomes a cause for the next principle (e.g) First he says yugta (united) that is the cause and then intellect and bhavana are the effects. and now if you develop bhavana, the bhavana itself becomes the cause for the next effect peace, and the peace itself become the cause for the effect success. 

As your bhav so your, whatever you are that is what your life is going to be, so today everything is happening to your life is the effect and what is the  cause is within you the bhavana, if something is not your liking instead of blaming something or blaming something outside immediately check your bhavana, somewhere something would have gone wrong.

"Yatha Bhavah, Tatha Asi". So we are the creator of our own destiny. It's not the planets defining our life, rather it is our actions and our bhavana that defines where we reach. Our actions are the sole causes for all the effects that we reap in our life.

 The chant of Shantithi, in the end of Om Sahanava Bhavatu. The reason we chant Om Shantihi three times is to negate the three disturbances Cosmic, External and Internal. 

Dimension of Shanthihi
1. Pacification - Appeasement - When something is pacified then that is in a state of shanthihi. 
When the mind develops a desire for something, it gets into a state of agitation. Shanthihi means we pacify those agitations of the mind. It is not only when we have desire but throughout the day when we observe our mind we see that we go through various experiences that also affects our state of mind.  We need to pacify our mind when it faces such experiences.

2. Calmness- Tranquility- When the mind is in a state of rest. The first and second dimension go hand in hand. When we pacify the mind it becomes calm.

3. `State of rest and ease` When the mind is in a state of rest or ease then that is called Shanthih. Shantihi comes from within and we have the power to not let any other external thing to come and disturb that peace. That power is in dormant stage right now. Through sadhana we need to awaken that.

Our body should be in a state of motion, and the mind in a state of Shanthihi. What ever the situation you might be in your life if you are over worked, not having a good relationship you must understand who can't fix the external factors which is disturbing your mind and keeping you away from your goal or happiness. You have to adapt according to the situation and overcome those difficults they are not the issues, but an oppurtunity to become stronger in your life. 

Next what is the permanent solution to all the stress and agitation ? To study that next dimension of shanthi `Settlement of difference` means resolving all the issues in your life. whenever you go through the experience once the experience ends externally you move to an another experience physically, but the mind does not move away from the previous experience, depending the prev expereince the mind goes on thinging about it and the mind absorbs those expereince and creates impressions. 
This impression also from your past karmas. Settlement of difference means going deep within yourself and removing all those impressions.

`Prati Prasav Sadhana` is a highly advanced sadhana to remove those karmic blocks or impressions. When a child is born it is prasav. Prati-prasav means you are again born in the memory, you go back to the very birth, the trauma when you were born, and you live it again. Remember, you don't remember it, you live it, you relive it again. this is a very, very significant process, the process of prati-prasav.

(e.g) A lady has a fear of eye opening dolls and she also had a dream where chukky doll comes stap her with a knife this is because of the past memories, she practised the  Prati-prasav sadhana and removed those past memories. 
the whole message. Don't live like a sleepy man, or a drunkard living in a hypnosis. Be conscious of whatsoever you are doing. Do it, but do it with full consciousness. Suddenly you will see many things disappear.

 Method to begin with: Daily in the night while going to bed for sleep go back in a flashback of what all has happened throughout the day , like before going to sleep you were having dinner , before that you were watching TV, before that you were driving back from office to home etc ,keep on going back just as in case of rewind button when you are playing something, till you get to the point when you got up in the morning.After some days of practice, you will start going back farther into your past ,correcting it.

`Shanthi means good fortune` When you remove all your karmic blocks and your mind is calm and tranquile, you receive the good things and good fortune in life.`Shanthi means sukam` When your mind is calm every experience in life will be peaceful and happiness. It is the bhavana which gives the calmness, so do with full bhavana positive vibration in your action.
`Ashanthi` is opposite of shanthi. It gives two things one is depression another is over excitement, both will make you unhappy, through the sadhana you can align to the center.
