As the ocean is unmoved when it is filled with water 
   from all quarters, so does one obtain peace,
in whom the objects desire enter, not the desirer of objects.

He continues the character of a person Sthithapragnya in this verse. The Ocean remains unmoved as the water enters from different direction, in such a way in whom all the objects of desire entire, not the desirer of object that person remains peace. The most important facet of Sthithapragnya is peace and its covered in the verse 70 and 71. Everything we do today is to attain peace, happiness.

We try to acquire different things in our life externally, however, in acquiring many things , we are seeking only one thing and that is happiness and peace. These external objects that we try to get is for our internal peace/happiness"
The goals in our life can be divided into three parts -
1) External - the objects that we acquire from the world
2) Subtler aspects - acquiring skills that requires both external help and internal effort
3) Spiritual growth - That is completely from within oneself. Inner transformation - bringing a change in oneself
To be in a state of Sthithapragnya is to be established in the higher wisdom eternally

`Sadhana:` Try to penetrate your own mind to find out what your seeking? Going deep your own action, emotion, You are currently seeking many things right now like wealth, health and relationship. But in all the seeking you ultimately seek is peace.

Don’t let my preconceived notions limit my experiences. Don’t impose restrictions on my life or on others. Be aware when I see myself doing this and pull myself back to an open minded state like a baby.

Though there are many different Gods, the infinite is only one. The forms are a way we focus our energy instead of the formless reality

You go through different experience in the life, but at the end what your are seeling is peace and happiness. The mind is under ilussion that it seeking manythings in life. You cannot draw line on how much many money you want? How much you want to have the sense enjoyment? You cannot draw a line because the mind is under illusion what ever your getting is less? and you have to get more.

`sa śhāntim āpnoti na kāma-kāmī` meaning of this line. 
`If your very clear with what your seeking is peace it doesn't matter how much you have, you will feel peaceful`, if your more caught up with that illusion, you will not be peaceful, but don't stop from acquiring wealth, don't become thamas, but bring this clarity that where you want to go.

What gives the Power to a Sthitha Pragnya when an individual is transformed to a Sthitha Pragnya? The Power comes from Shanthi or inner peace.

Most people lead mechanical lives. We are caught up in our daily activities and so enmeshed in them that we don't have the time to question why we are doing an activity. "Yoga Maya" puts an illusion over us and we are robbed of our time and before we know it 20-30-40 years have passed. As Adi Shankara says "kala kreedathi gachhat ..." - time sports with us and eons pass. How to break this? Put in the effort to become aware and request the Guru Shakthi. Be deep and refined in every action. Do it deeply or don't do it at all. Goals give direction to our actions.

As we go about various activities in life, even though the activities are different, they are all performed with the same ultimate goal, to obtain peace. A purposeful action is that which achieves the goal. If we acquire wealth or a relationship and that causes us stress, it isn't purposeful. Instead if it is done in a way that gives us peace, that action is purposeful and will help us, even though that peace is temporary, because we will be more calm during personal Sadhana which gives us the permanent inner peace. Lord Krishna says later that all of us have to act; we cannot not act. What the great Yogis figured out was that if we perform any action while being aware that we are doing it to obtain peace, we will automatically do it in a way that results in peace. We will also seek objects and perform actions (how we speak, think, feel and act) that reduce agitation and bring us peace.

Just as an ocean is unmoved by the waters that enter it from all quarters, so does one obtain peace in whom the objects of desire enter, not the desirer of objects .

Samudra refers to the ocean. The quality of the ocean is Paripoorna . Poorna is complete and Paripoorna is being completely complete, complete in all dimensions. The divine aspect of Paripoorna is also illustrated in the Maha Shiva Dhyana and in the Eesa Vashya Upanishad. That which it came from is complete and Infinite. That which came from it is complete and Infinite. That which is left over is complete and Infinite. We feel that we are incomplete and hence seek to "complete" ourself. I am already Paripoorna completely complete.

All gods are divine energies within us that we have not tapped yet. Ganesha represents the energy of success. Goddess Lakshmi is said to come from the ocean when being churned and represents not just wealth but every type of abundance - wealth, relationships, etc. But the secret mystery behind Goddess Lakshmi is that she also represents inner abundance. As an aspiring Yogi, focus on achieving the external abundance by recognizing that it is a manifestation of the inner abundance. The Upanishads describe the path of evolution and devolution. Dharma leads to Kama (in this case Ichha) which leads to Bhoga which leads to Moksha. Adharma leads to kama (uncontrolled desire) that leads to Aasakthihi (attachment) which leads to adhogathi (destruction). In the very middle of the Gita in the 9th chapter, Krishna says "Yoga kshemam". Here yoga refers to internal happiness and kshemam refers to external happiness or bhoga. Lord Krishna says focus on "me" (here, the Infinite) and you will get both internal and external happiness.

The feeling of gratitude makes us appreciate our Paripoorna.

Sadhana homework:
Every morning, express gratitude to the Supreme, the Guru and other holy masters, parents, spouse, children, friends. As we feel more grateful, we feel more whole.
