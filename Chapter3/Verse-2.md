vyāmiśhreṇeva vākyena buddhiṁ mohayasīva me
tad ekaṁ vada niśhchitya yena śhreyo ’ham āpnuyām

WIth intermixed statements as it were, you are seemingly confusing my understanding. Tell me decisively one thing by which I may obtain the best.

```

Arjuna thinks Krishna is confusing him and is being indecisive. This reflects how confused Arjuna is. But actually, the Master responds to the student based on the real need not the stated question. The Master with a smile takes everything the student throws at him and yet still guides him. What a miracle!

The relationship between the master and the student is of the following three stages.

The quality of the emotition increases when a student go through this stages.

1. Appreciation
2. Bhakthi / Devotion 
3. Surrender 


1. Appreciation: 
	- When we start noticing and appreciating the goodness in something, it makes us get closer to that person. It gives rise to Love (Devotion) towards that person. 
	- An extroverted mind will not like the classical music. An introverted mind will accept and appreciate the classical music which will help relax the mind. (27:00). Always go by the quality.
	- Associating with the things that the Guru teaches will help us appreciate it and adopt into our lives. 

2. Bhakthi/Devotion :	
	- As we appreciate the teachings taught by the master, we slowly turn into being Devoted to the master. 
	- What is the difference between Appreciation and Devotion ? 
		- The difference is in the degree of intensity. 
		- There is a personal connection that starts getting generated with the master spiritually. 
		- Love is the emotion directed to the world. 
		- Devotion is the emotion directed towards something Higher. 
		- Devotion is a kind of Love. This is why it is said Love is God. 
	- When there is a feeling of Gratitude, there is always a feeling of Appreciation and Devotion. (34:00)
	- Bhakthi means Unconditional love and Gratitude
	- When there is Gratitude towards a person, there is always a reciprocation from the other end as well. It may or may not be known to the shishya, but the Guru always has unconditional love towards the student.

3. Surrender: 
	- The difference between Devotion and Surrender is in the Intensity. 
	- As we increase the devotion and approach the teacher and follow the guidance, there will be a point when we completely surrender to the master. It is not an easy path, but will take a lot of devotion and belief in order to reach. 
	- Surrender is process a process of get away from the ego. It removes the block or revealed to attuned to the master
	  frequency

There are also three blocks a student goes through in the process of surrendering.
            One is the physical block where the master gives the student some tasks to complete. Even though the master does not need help as he is the highest; but the master gives the student some task to test the level of his/ her surrender. The task may be very bitter in the beginning, but there we should increase our will power to experience the bitterness to attain a sweet destination.
           Next is the emotional block where the student's mind doubts the master's intentions. The intellectual block is what makes the student think that the master has not understood his/ her problem clearly and he seems to confuse the student. But finally the master would never want to confuse his student but the student feels so as he is so confused.


As it is told in the KARMA YOGA that whatever happens to us in the present, it is because of our past actions. So no point in blaming other factors for our consequences. This doesn't mean we have to put ourselves down and blame ourselves for the present circumstances. It means we have the power to create our life by acting consciously in the present. If someone insults us, we should become mentally strong,not letting others vibrations to impact on our minds and solve the issue with them. 

We should always have a simple mind. We may think that analyzing on a thing too much is getting clarified. But more and more we analyze it means the more we have a confused mind. 
Simple mind is being innocent, letting go things which we think that we know, eager to learn new things. In worldly education it is important for us to take in knowledge. But in spiritual education the more and more we let go  things, the more and more our receptivity and surrender gets intensified.


- Sadhana tip: Aim for a Simplistic mind/Simplistic thinking. More analysis or complex thinking is not the way. 
- Always understand the principle behind and act accordingly.

`tad ekaṁ vada niśhchitya yena śhreyo ’ham āpnuyām` Arjuna ask krishna tell me one thing decisively that is best to me. `shreyo` means to obtain that is good to onself from the external world and that is best. The sadhana we learn from the word shreyaga is in life I have to choose things that is good for me, whether its food, relationship with other. Shreyaga is some good that will help you in longer run, and preyaga is the immdediate pleasure do not choose preyaga, how to identify shreyaga and preyaga if an experience that is going to interfere your longer wish(shreyaga) then that is preyaga.

To attain the best and to merge with infinite first thing to do is practise shreyaga, next put in the effort pay the price to obtain the shreyaga. Your effort only set the direction to attain the shreyaga, if not the energy will be generalized and the energy won't be going in the direction to achieve shreyaga.

Eventhough Arjuna asked krishna tell the best option to him, kirshna the master will never say it directly he will go round until Arjuna knows himself what is best to him ? A student first have to seek the master guidance, then master depending the student grasping power will guide him to attain the shreyaga.
