```
indriyāṇāṁ hi charatāṁ yan mano ’nuvidhīyate
tadasya harati prajñāṁ vāyur nāvam ivāmbhasi

The mind which follows the roving senses,
indeed carries away the wisdom like the wind(carriers away)
a boat on water.
```
He has taken a long journey that is the ladder of fall, and finally he comes to the stita pragnia the pragna aspect and how the whole things robs your wisdom. 
In your life your thoughts, your thinking should be very well organized and focused. _**It is only a person who is focused can achieve anything in life.**_

Many factors will try to pull you away from your goal. By doing the sadhana, and being discipline you can achieve your goal. Don't get in to the illusion, know your purpose know your goal and take necessary action to achieve it. Once Naratha asked lord vishnu what is maya? Vishnu took him to a desert and told i will answer to your question but before i answer to your question, I'm feeling thirsty can you get me a glass of water. 
Naratha went in search of water in the desert, Vishu created a beautiful city by illusion there naradha met a beautiful girl and marrier that girl, they gave birth to many child and lived their for many years, after some years Naradha had some problem in life, and he said to god why are you give me so much of problem?
Vishnu appeared to Naradha thats all fine, but where is the glass of water i asked you ? Naradha remember why he came to this place? Similarly don't bogdown with the issue which pulls you away from reaching your goal. 

When your sense center aren't in control your sense organs (eyes, ears, tongue, skin, nose) will wander for sense objects. If your sense center aren't in control then the mind won't be in control. when your mind, your thoughts, and thinking aren't focused your entire wisom will be carried away. 

The name Govinda has different dimensions, Govinda means one who control the cow herads. The cow grace with out a control, and doesn't follow a direction, so govinda control the cows and direct them. Here cows are the senses, control your sense(center) organs to control the mind. 

Think about how much time you spend in the social platforms, watching TV. Your living a mechanicl life without knowing the purpose of your life (eg) you work from the morning to the evening without knowing why are you working? Finding your purpose of life is a life long quest? First start with the absolute level, live a happy life, have best of best things in your life.

In this verse krishna connects all the previous verses together first he talks about the pragna(wisdom), and then he practically talks about the senses then a deep analysis how the mind goes out of your control. In this ladder of fall there is also the solution of bhavana, practising sadhana to come out of the fall. we also talked about how you should be organised and structured in your life but how to be organised and structured ? If you look the ant they run helder skelder but if you put a sugar bit they all form a line and approach the sugar bit in a discipline way. In similar way today there are various emotions various thoughts running in different direction. what is the sweet here is the purpose of life, and the purpose of life is happiness. You experiment many things in your life to experience the happiness. Right from the start of childhood experimenting with toys, later with relationship, name and fame. 
if you want your mind to be disciplined and structured forcing will not work. The more you force more will be resistence for a while. First of all you need to find your goal and there will be enough factors to distract you from achieving the goal. Once you understand the purpose of the life all your emotition, thoughts, actions will be towards the goal.

`indriyāṇāṁ hi charatāṁ` The senses are roving(moving) let us take the site you have the sense object which is the eye(sense organ) and then the optical nerve which is the gross aspect, and then the sense center which is the outer most layer its a layer between the organ and the mind. when you see an object it should be register in the sense center then your perception will be completed. Eventhough the object register in the rectina (organ) but if its not registered in the sense center you will not be recognize it.
How to master over indriyanam ni charatam ? When you experience something be focused and experience fully it could be something like eating your favourite food  bring all your energy and experience that and then after the experience is over don't sit and lingering on that experience move to the next experience.
`yan mano ’nuvidhīyate` The person who has no control over the sense will not have control over his own mind. When the senses controls you it will start controlling the mind the mind will not even pause for a second but it will simply follow the sense objects. When the mind is carried away the emotions is also carried away which is a dangerous situation. 

When a person is in emotion(e.g) sorrow, depression, anger any amount of advise will not pull him out of the emotion. Its only through the pradnya(wisdom) that person can be pulled from that emotion. When Arjuna was not ready to battle in the battlefield Krishna didn't say anything but simply smiled and preached what is right and wrong? He basically expanded the pradnya aspect within Arjuna and gave the wisdom.

`The way we act right now is the sense objects(Mobile, TV) carries away the sense organs(eye) and the sense center carries  away the mind, that carries away the emotion, which is a dangerous situation and that may lead to destroying the whole wisdom.
What we have to do is reverse the process First expand the pradnya(Wisdom) aspect which will pull the emotion, mind when the mind in control it can pull back the sense center, which intern stop the sense objects carrying away the sense organs`.

`Law of cause and effect` Our scripture are written based on the principle of connection (eg) if you are not united you won't have buddhi, if you dont have buddhi, you don't have bhavana, and if you don't have that he will not have peace and happiness. This is called law of cause and effect, law of karma and it is based on the principle of connection and interconnection. How one leads to another?
    
A person who understand the principle of connection he will be successful in all the activity he do.There is a chain reaction if you have an issue in one area of your life will affected the another area of the life. (e.g) If your boss shout at the office, and you expose your anger to your spouse, and child the confident level of the child will go down.

Every word and action of you radiate a particular type of energy and its affect you and others.`prajñāṁ vāyur nāvam ivāmbhasi` He uses an example the boat is carried away in the water by the wind. Here the boat is you the pradnya aspect within you and the water is your life and the wind is your emotion. In your life there will be ups and down and various challenges and oppurtunity. Not only the wind can carry away the boat from its choosen path but it can also topple.

Andrea del sarto the famous artists who lossed his fame because of the deep love emotition with his girl friend. One emotition is enough to move you away from your goal and topple.

`Sadhana` what is the first thing you need to do to achieve your destination? Take the example of rowing the boat sometimes you don't need to row the boat in the downstream, and sometimes you have to row more when going in the upstream. Here rowing is effort Without effort you cannot achieve the destination.
1. `Effort` Hardwork your willing to put in your life.
2. `Right direction` Fix a goal to reach the destination.
3. `Strength` to face the ups and down.
4. `Withstand inner challenges` Ability to withstand the different emotion in your life.

`Law of connection` we have 4 aspect or stages in your life
- First aspect is your gazing with no goals, no questions doing things mechanically. you will start following others. This is called hard instinct like a sheep keep falling from a cliff one after another without understanding why the previous sheep fall? This is a purpose less life. Here is there is no awarness
- Second aspect is connecting unconnected things. Superstituous things connecting causes to unconnected effect(bell ringing is a good sign)
- Third aspect is awaerness there, questioning and connecting causes to the right effect. If something negative happening in your life probe the problem and find the cause for that effect..
- Fourth stage is the stage of contemplating in this stage your able to penetrate deeply find the cause for the effect, but what is the deeper cause? when your in this stage you will be able to go deeper what are the energy your creating? what are the bhavana? what are the karmic block your creating? 
Only when your in the fourth stage your pradnya effect grows day by day. You connect with the divine energy. You become sthitha pragna one who established or connected with the divine.

To be a successful person in any field you need the wisdom for an example take your software carrier you first need the knowledge and then the practical skill to be a knowledgable person in that field. Just the bookies knowledge will not help you to shine you need that practical skill. The `wisdom is the boat` the praknya to sail from the finite aspect to the infinte aspect. When the boat is weak it will sink, so strengthen your pradnya(wisdom) to face the challenges and sail.

There are two types of challenges one is external and another is internal challenges. You will see the ups and downs in life, a life without challenges is not possible to face the challenges the sadhana you do will help to over come the challenges. The `external challenges are like water`, you can see and adjust to those challenges where as the `internal challenges are like wind(vāyur)` that is your emotion. Anywhere your emotion is not under your control it will pull down, but if they are in control and you can convert those emotion into a supportive factor. How  you do that ? Its only possible when you have a goal in your life, so when you fix your destination very very clearly then what happens is when ever external challenge comes you will see how to over come the challenge and reach the goal. 

The ultimate goal is becoming sita pragnya, now see the relative goals. Take this principal and apply in those areas.let us take your carrier as an example. 
First your boat is the wisdow are you a knowledgeable and skillful person in your carrier ? Ask expert in the field to know about it. 
Is your boat strong ? Do I have a clear cut goal ? Now when this two things are clear then you will get the strength to face the challenges. Do i buckle down when something goes down ? Do I stop the effort immediately? when ever there is an emotion comes do i stop work effectively? Mood swings then the productivity will come down.

Emotions are energy in motion you have to direct your emotion to your goal. First fix a goal in each area (carrier, wealth, relationship). Define a goal and do things to achieve this will indirectly channelize your energy towards those goal. 
Wealth: I want an x amount of money. I want to buy a house.
Relationship: I want to bring my child good in their carrier. I want to keep my mother,partner and others happy.
carrier: I want a progressive carrier learn and develop my skills.
Health: Read about immune system, healthy foods. exercise
## Principle of movement
This verse contains three main words which forms a principle.
1. `charatāṁ` that is roving(moving) mindelessly.
2. `anu vidhīyate` obedentially following
3. `harathi` means carrying away

Whereever there is no movement there will be stagnation. The world is constantly moving, if you don't move you will be stagnatted. Ask yourself 
are you moving ? Are you becoming a better person day by day?  Only when you keep transform yourself daily, weekly and yearly you will become a sthithapragna.

Movements can be move up and another is move down, either way its possible. 

 The first words is `charatāṁ` that is roving(moving) mindelessly. It means moving for a instant pleasure and not aiming for the long term goal.
 The mind has the tendency of pickup the short term benefit and stop there itself.
 
 How this starts happening? Taken an example of sense objects the sense objects gives some kind of immediate pleasure so your sense organ and sense center(indriyani) is attracted by this sense pleasure and it will pull, but you have choice of action one is continuing or come out of that attraction if you don't exercise the choice then this will completely devol you. The principle is don't get caughtup with the immediate pleasure or instant gratification. Aim for the higher goal. Your movement in life should be for achieving higher things in life if you don't move then you stagger and devolve. 

Ask yourself are you improving in your life ? Are you becoming a better person by week and by month? Is your movement is towards your ultimate goal? which is achieveing best things in the life and connecting with the infinite. If your caught up with the immediate pleasure or not moving in your life you will move to the next stage which is `anu vidhīyate` is a deeper kind of movement an intense movement. Obedentially following without questioning all your emotion going toward a direction if the direction is positive then its wonderful. if the direction is negative it is bad. First is the instant pleasure and that pulls the whole mind and the emotions get attached to the person or object. You form a deep emotional connections with that object, so for an exmple if your taking alcohol on the weekends as and when the times you seek to take alcohol or if you see someone is drinking your mind will ask you to take alchol. you gradually form a habit once the habit is established it is hard to break it.
once your in the `anu vidhīyate` the choice of action is reduced you simply follow the movement obedentially.


`harathi` means carrying away your wisdom, and you addicted to the object. you start to jusify your actions.

When there is a movement there will be a direction implied. The direction can be either downwards or upward it depends on the movement. If you don't move also that is stagnated in life it will pull you down, in each and every activity you do this 3 movements(`charatam, Anu vidhiyate, Harathi`) are always there, then how this movement principle can be used in your life ? 

 `General principle` Your mind seek for immdediate pleasures for an example negative news such as corono virus, how many of them died because of that virus. It will not seek for positive news like how to boost your immune system and fight against the virus. How many of them recovered from that virus?. Read artciles and news about the immune system which is charatam stage, this automatically put you in the anu vidhiyati stage where in you eat good foods, doing exercises and by following you will be in harathi stage it will be come a part of your life.
 
 `Good habit formation` A good habit formation takes time, it will also follow this 3 movements. Suppose you want to very fit and do yogasankithan sadana every day.  first in the charatam stage read about the benefits of exercise, healthy foods and listen to courses and podcasts. Your automatically start doing the exercise and yoga now your in the `anu vidhīyate` stage. You go on repeating it and your emotions drive here and your wisdom also increases and you will be in the harithi stage. 
 `Daily exercise may not give immediate pleasure, but slowly you will enjoy it and get the benefit`

How do you apply this principle and achieve the goal?
When your destination is clear you will know the direction to the goal. Fix a goal. 

1. `charatāṁ` Causually think about the goal. Keep a reminder for your goals. Gather more information for achieving the goal.Allow your senses to look after information to achieve the goal.
2. `anu vidhīyate` When you follow the `charatāṁ` you get inspired to your goal. You form a personal connection to your goal. Once you get inspired your efforts will double up. You will start looking for various opportunities.
3. `harathi` Your entire thinking process (wisdom) will be aligned with your goal. The goal will become a reference to you and every action you do you will think whether this action will help me achieve your goal. 

Finally the ultimate goal in your life is to experience the happiness and best of the best in your life. The ultimate purpose of life is to 
merge with the infinite, so listen to spirtual discourses, meditation, prayers in the charatam, this put you inspired to do the sadhana and mediation until you merge with infinite.
