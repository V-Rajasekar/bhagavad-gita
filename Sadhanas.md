### Sadhana practise

> 1) Experiencing fully where you don't have weakness and withdrawing where you have weakness.
> 2) when you work in selfish way it will lower your consciousness, but when you work for higher cause, when you day seva it raises consciousness.
> 3) Remove/Filter irrelevant or negative informations and also observe what are the kind of input am I taking it willingly.
>4) When ever your effected by anything immedetiatley split the experience in to two. One is the triggering factor outside and other is the reaction with in you.
>5) *I'm **not able**  to express my thoughts in a discussion or meeting*. 
>**Instead say** "***I choose*** *to not to express my thoughts in a discussion or meeting*."  what ever you choose from your depth no force in the world can prevent you from doing that.
>6) Dont meet the problem half way let the problem meet you dont spin your opinion on that problem which basically agreegate it. Don't play a screen in your mind whether the other person will accept what your saying.
>7) when ever you get time start observing what is around you(e.g)things in your living room. Go in details of that observe it in detail and then close your eyes and try to recall this will increase the `smrithi`shathi in you the moha will loose his power in you.Great monks like Swami Ramakrishna, Vivekananda have practised it.It will give you sharpness and this helps smartness.
>8) If you know which way you fallen then you automatically know which way to raise. As `Albert Einstein` he said
 ```
 Every problem has a solution, and the solution lies within the problem itself
  ```
  When your solving a problem penetrate fully and understand the problem, without understanding the problem fully when you try to solve the problem you will make mistakes.

  Understand the concept and principle to avoid superfical solution.
 >9) Start developing the `aspects of buddhi (verse 63)` so buddhi is not just gaining knowledge learn to analyze clear and learn to decide clearly and that awarness.
 >10) Everytime your gaining knowledge don't close your mind by getting in to a feel yes, I know instead feel I begin to understand. 

 ## what is life ?
  Our yogi's say life is `Anubhava dhara` means a flow of experiences. If you want your life to be wonderful then the flow of experience to be wonderful, and if you want the flow of experience to be wonderful then you have to ensure each and every experience wonderful. 

   One way is to see your life as a whole and other way is to see your entire life as one experience, if you put your heart and soul in each of your experience then the entire life will be one of high quality. But what we do is ignore individual experience we ignore quality and more concern about the quantity. 

   Dropping the tendency to rush through life without how your functioning at micro level(e.g) if a batsman play every ball properly automatically he will hit the centuries. This is the secret of life, so you should be your heart and soul in each small task.

   Once the follower of Budhha asked about what is the origin of universe? Buddha said you should penerate first. He took a flower and asked his students to mediate on the flower, the students mediated on the flower by closing their eyes. Buddha asked what did you see they said we mediated on the flower look petals, its color and smell. Buddha you should go further deeper. where does this flower come from its from tree, and then its origin is from a seed. By the end of the origin you will get to the origin of universe. 

   `when ever you want to do something ask yourself will this action will be good for me good for others also if the answer is yes do otherwise avoid it`

   > Fix a goal, follow your swadharma and formulate a schedule to direct your likes and dislikes to make a decision and take a action. 

   ` Do your duties properly and you will get your rights and rewards` 

Don't center your consciousness to worldly things like name. fame and sense objects. When anything goes wrong outside the world your mind gets disturbed, if  you say isn't it natural ? if we entertain this philosphy your growth will get stunned it is not where your are that matters but what direction are you taking whatever level you are in as long as your improving day by day as long as you becoming better person your growing spirtually then its fine. if you stop growing then there will stagnation there will be decay and death.
The natural itself is moving running water, breeze, the planet and sun is revolving and the entire galaxy is revolving

`Do your actions happly`. When your in action do it with full happiness. when you speak to someone do it with happiness.

> Don't look for profit or gains or success without effort.

> `A person who develops purity and make his/her mind calm and   also the intellect is sharp can achieve anything in the life.`

what is the best form of wealth which you should occur ? which solves all the issues in your life ?
It's the ancient wisdom. A person with calm mind and sharp intellect can acquire the worldly wisdoms that is wealth, relationship, knowledge. Only through the sharp mind one can know the physcology of other person.

> `Enjoy small small experiences in life then the whole life will be very happy.` 
> `The more passionate you are about what ever your doing the more successful you'll be your relationship will be wonderful you'll start spending quality time with your friends and family.`

*When you do things with doubt then that action doesn't have any power.*

>*Your atitude measures altitude*

> Practise remember all the positive things happen today, and do gratitude  before you go to bed and after you awake do gratitude for all the good things the god has given.
> You might have a desire, but your desire comes to true when your deservable person for it. Here the effort thats matter.
> Start looking at life as an oppurtunity to grow, and not as a difficult to pull you down.
> To be peaceful and happiness you have to practise this three aspects first prasadam that is accepting the things as it is, if you see a cow you pat, but not the same thing you do for a scorpion or snake because you asses it and change yourself how to interactive with it. But we humanbeing fail to asses the fellow humanbeings
we want the other person or things to behave as we expect it. you should reverse the process.
Second Prasanna means brightness, you accepted the things but you shouldn't passive (e.g) you assess and accept your room is not clean, then you should put effort to clean it similarly in any part of your life if you if you see a problem assess and take action. Next Shanthi means calmness when your prasanna don't be too excited, but do things in peacefully.

> You should curb the tendency of the senses to go on their own, When you fix a goal, a plan or program then the senses will not go on their own. 

## Principle of movement (Charatam, Anu vidhīyate, Harathi)
The world is keep moving if you stagnate in your life, it will devolve you, so move in your life. The movement can be in either way towards postive object, higher goal or negative object if you move towards the postive object you will evolve otherwise you will devolve.

It's your goal which drives you to right direction, so write down your goal in different areas of life (carrier, health, wealth, relationship). Next the movement has 3 stages the first stage is `Charatam` in this stage you gather or seek information which is relevant to your goal, spend your spare time to read, listen, practise things which will help to achive your goal this will automatically put you in to the next stage (`Anu vidhiyate`) you get inspired with the goal and you double up your effort to achieve your goal. Finally `Harathi` Your entire thinking process (wisdom) will be aligned with your goal. The goal will become a reference to you and every action you do you will think whether this action will help me achieve your goal. 

The sadhana of `mahā-bāho` look at the good aspect within you, and others around you.
