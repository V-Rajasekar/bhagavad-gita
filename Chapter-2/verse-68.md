When the master talks about the ladder of fall in previous verses. Itsn't more focusing on the negative things rather its 
identifying the problems in the ladder of fail and seeking a solution for it. When you approach an issue or problem don't merely 
focus on the negative things your intension should be to get ride of the problem.
Next, You know the problem and the solution, but if you don't practise the principles it will not help you to resolve that problem.

This 2 principle of identifying the problem in your life and find a solution, practising the principle to solve will help in your 
decision making. How does a master make a conclusion or decision ? Here tasmād means concluding.
How to ensure your decision are effective?
 The master conclude based on the following tools.
1. `Logical analysis` Don't going by supervisical. Blind belief
2. `Deep feeling or bhavana` he used to approach the problem. Your emotion, bhavana 

The logical analysis and emotions are the two peddles of a cycle, you have to apply them correctly only logical analysis will not be applicable 
to make a decision e.g Taking child carrier decision will the child enjoy if he/she takes the course. 
A person who feels what ever he is thinking an a person who thinks what every he is feeling he is the one who get the wisdom. Both has to support each other.Thinking gives the direction, and feeling gives you don't become dry. 

`tasmād` means conclusion. Your every action in your life is based on what your convinced about if you think your immunce system can combat with the virus and protect you will be healthy here the mind place the vital role. If you convinced about the something you will do it by default. How you develop more passion, focus? Its all based on how much your convinced about it. what are convinced about ? whatever conclusions you make in life that is what convinces you, and conclusion based on the knowledge gain from the world.

If you want to change your behaviour, emotions and thoughts I need to work on my conclusions. A master makes a conclusion (therefore) which will be aligned with the spiritual law(dharma nyati). There is a spiritual law for the mind, body and work, so all your conclusion should be aligned to those dharma nyati.

Krishna call Arjuna as `mahā-bāho`(mighty arm & shoulder) he is recognizing arjuna positive aspect and making him self confidence.Krishan inspiring Arjuna and cycologically preparing him to receieve the conclusion. Similarly see the good aspects within you and in others around you will develop your self confidence.
