                 arjuna uvācha
   jyāyasī chet karmaṇas te matā buddhir janārdana
     tat kiṁ karmaṇi ghore māṁ niyojayasi keśhava
      vyāmiśhreṇeva vākyena buddhiṁ mohayasīva me
   tad ekaṁ vada niśhchitya yena śhreyo ’ham āpnuyām

Arjuna said:
If you consider knowledge superior to action O Janardhana,
then why do you engage me in this terrible action O Kesava?
```

Each chapter of the Bhagavad Gita is complete in itself; it is a path and a goal. So one doesn't have to worry if you don't learn the entire Gita.
In fact, each verse is complete in itself. For yogis, each principle conveyed in one verse is itself complete.

Uvacha
Arjuna is not merely saying. He is seeking.
All scriptures are in the form of questions and answers. When the question is relevant, the answer will be revealed. This also tells us that spirituality
is same as science in terms of posing questions and finding solutions. Both logic and belief are important in science and spirituality. Science applies to 
the outside world and spirituality focuses the inner growth.

A yogi is always learning. It is only that he or she is auto pilot mode when it comes to learning.

It is the ego that prevents us from learning. The ego makes us think that asking questions is a sign of weakness.

In the first chapter, Arjuna had been merely complaining, so Krishna didn't offer advice and just listened. In the second chapter, he started seeking and
in particular, asked about a Sthitha Pragnya. Krishna explained the ladder of downfall of the mind and how loss of buddhi will lead to destruction.  
So Arjuna mistakenly assumed that Krishna was saying knowledge was superior to action. In fact, Krishna had given the importance of action (karma) 
earlier in Chapter 2. 

A yogi sees all aspects of life the same. There is nothing which is superior or inferior.

In spirituality we look at overall, a balance in everything in life. Little bit of na , bhakti yoga, karma yoga
one portition dedicated to medidation, certain time dedicate to physical activity, eating, drinking, and breathing.

While cooking we add so many elements chilli, salt, masala even one is missed it will spoil the taste of the food. 
If you think one aspect is superiority then you will have lopsided development.

Sadhana: Aim at an overall development, don't focus on one aspect because it will lead to lopsided development.

Matham

Arjuna states Krishna has the opinion (considers) that knowledge is superior to action. A Master does not have opinions. He just acts on facts. 
Don't jump to conclusions about people based on some actions. Compile the information and determine the facts. A master always goes by fact,
and a common person goes with the opinion without the facts. A master has no bias he firmly grounded on the facts, and yet Arjuna uses the word Matha

When you relate people you project your opinion on that person and you judge the person based on the opinion. Its a human Psychology as a sadhaka don't come to 
a conclusion based on your opinion, you have to collect the facts before judging the person.
