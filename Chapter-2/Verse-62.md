When a humanbeing thinks on sense objects.
He gets attached to it. From attachment borns desire
From desire borns anger.

In verse 62 and 63 he describes the ladder of fall and overcome it. Its help you to **Master your own mind**

Only the humanbeing have the choice of action and not the other creatures in this world, so if a humanbeing's uncontrolled thoughts 
(e.g) without conciousness and fully awarness thinks on sense object it become dangers. First filter your thoughts with full awarness whether its good or bad to him and others. 

The choice of action can lead to evolve or divolve oneself in spirtual life and as well in the material world. If a humanbeing kill someone its called murder there is an karma attach to it and it wil devolve them. where as if an animal kills its prey there is no kara attached, so they don't devolve its there nature.

`dhyāyato` thought could also be a casual thought which is quite dangers.(e.g) A Drug addicted person takes drugs casually then lose themselves.

`vishayan` sense objects which gives information from the world, so since as a humanbeing you have this natural urge to explore the mind will go on it own and try to gather information from the world. You can't stop it then what could we do ?

Using my choice of action I can direct the mind to those objects which can give you positive informations, but if I try to cut off this exploratory nature of the mind then your stifling the very nature of the mind such person will not go he/she will stunt (e.g) bonzai tree doesn't grow if there roots are cut off.

why mind goes on its own? It is inorder to gather information about that object 
why is it mind want to gather information? that is the very natural urge of mind to explore and gain knowledge its like other urges (hunger, thirsty) which you can't be stopped.
`dhyāyato` the other dimension of it's casual thinking. Casual thinking comes when you get boredom, when mind doesn't find anything interesting
it gets boredom, or when you don't enjoy your life. This boredom may lead to overeating, addiction towards sense objects(watching TV), drugs. 

How to avoid boredom ?
- Follow your swadharma that is do which is interested to enjoyable to you
- Enjoy simple actions in our daily day to day lifes ( Brushing your teeth, Bathing, Drinking water, cooking and eating)
- When work is enjoyable that work will start giving relaxation.
- Go in-depth in your field like reading and understanding  the basics in your field. 
If you practise the above mind will never get boredom if you stop this mind will start finding other avenues to overcome boredom like casual thinkings. 

`dhyāyato` 3rd dimension is calling to mind (recall) after an experience the mind has the tendency to call back the object if this happens without your awareness again your _frittering_ away your energies. 
The more recalling the things in mind it develops attachment addiction and further produces more negativity. 
when you recall some in your past with awareness is fine. In scriptures never said don't think about past and future and live in present it's infact

`Don't be worry about the past and don't be anxious about future.`

when does mind recall (go back to object again and again) when ever you contact the object and that object gives either pleasure or pain. Depending on the intensity of pleasure or pain the mind will recall that object to that extend. 
when the mind start generating the thoughts on the objects on its own that will lead to `sangas teṣhūpajāyate` the attachment will be produced

`sangas teṣhūpajāyate`
`1. sangah` - attached to people or object is deadly it is the cause for your suffering. 
When our mind generates thoughts towards the objects we call it Dhyaihi but when the same thoughts become intense without awareness it gathers more strength then we get attachment to that any object or could be a person. 

`ūpajāyate` means something which is born or produced on its own.  Sanghah+jayate: The attachment that is born on its own without awareness.

`2. sangah` is also means union becoming unit with the person or object mentally. what ever happens to the person it happens to you as well as you got united with that person. (e.g) Healer, Social service people.

**sadhana tips:** 

what kind of sangah(associating) you need in your life?
 - Choose what your are assocating with the books, the programs you watch. 

*From attachment is born desire*

when this uncontrolled attachment to a person or object mentally happens there borns `kamaka`. Kamaka means uncontrolled desire and its different from `itcha` (a fillfull desire). Kamaka is dangereous than itchas because it uncontrolled. Itcha sakthi is good one its like you setting your goal and achieving them in life. 

`Kamaka` force is so much that will push you in action to occure an object at any cost even in(unrighteous way).  

*From desire is born anger*

Once you develop kamaka the next thing born in desire. The word desire in this context is Kamaka. Anger is one modification of desire. when ever you have kamaka (a desire to experience and possess something). There are 3 possibilities can be traced out.

1. desire fullfilled

when ever a desire is fullfilled you will enjoy it but its temporary state of enjoyment, but before go through the enjoyment you develop `low baha` (greed you want more). If you move from a rented house to your own house your desire fullfilled temporarly, after sometimes you start developing comparing your house with people who dont have house/smaller house and people having bigger house in this case *low baha* further develops you will become very arrogance towards people  who are lower than you and you will become very envious towards people who are having more than you. 
you will develop a complex superiority towards people lower and inferiority towards people higher than you. You cannot be peaceful if you develop this complexes in life. 

The moment you have matha(pride) the further development is very dangerous, you start miss using it the object(power, wealth), the more power, wealth you get you has to become more humble.

There is one more thing called matsuriya(jealeous) you start developing a inferiority complex on people above you. 

 2. desire is unfullfilled 

When ever your desire is not fullfilled you will become sorrow. 
 
 3. Desire can get obstructed.  

why you get angry? when ever you have a desire you will have lot of expectations when those expectations are obstructed you become angry. There can be no anger without expectations and there can  be no expectations without kamaka(desire). 

Don't have expectation but have wish. when the obstuction is little bit it is called irritation but when the obstruction becomes intense then that stage is called anger. when this energey of irritation is directed to somebody is called anger. when it is directed to yourself is called frustration. 

In this verse its mentioned from desire borns anger, but guruji jas explained the different modifications as mentioned above. fear, greed, pride, jealous, inferiority, depression, sorrow
