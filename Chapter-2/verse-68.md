When the master talks about the ladder of fall in previous verses. Itsn't more focusing on the negative things rather its 
identifying the problems in the ladder of fail and seeking a solution for it. When you approach an issue or problem don't merely 
focus on the negative things your intension should be to get ride of the problem.
Next, You know the problem and the solution, but if you don't practise the principles it will not help you to resolve that problem.

This 2 principle of identifying the problem in your life and find a solution, practising the principle to solve will help in your 
decision making. How does a master make a conclusion or decision ? Here tasmād means concluding.
How to ensure your decision are effective?
 The master conclude based on the following tools.
1. `Logical analysis` Don't going by supervisical. Blind belief
2. `Deep feeling or bhavana` he used to approach the problem. Your emotion, bhavana 

The logical analysis and emotions are the two peddles of a cycle, you have to apply them correctly only logical analysis will not be applicable 
to make a decision e.g Taking child carrier decision will the child enjoy if he/she takes the course. 
A person who feels what ever he is thinking an a person who thinks what every he is feeling he is the one who get the wisdom. Both has to support each other.Thinking gives the direction, and feeling gives you don't become dry. 

`tasmād` means conclusion. Your every action in your life is based on what your convinced about if you think your immunce system can combat with the virus and protect you will be healthy here the mind place the vital role. If you convinced about the something you will do it by default. How you develop more passion, focus? Its all based on how much your convinced about it. what are convinced about ? whatever conclusions you make in life that is what convinces you, and conclusion based on the knowledge gain from the world.

If you want to change your behaviour, emotions and thoughts I need to work on my conclusions. A master makes a conclusion (therefore) which will be aligned with the spiritual law(dharma nyati). There is a spiritual law for the mind, body and work, so all your conclusion should be aligned to those dharma nyati.

Krishna call Arjuna as `mahā-bāho`(mighty arm & shoulder) he is recognizing arjuna positive aspect and making him self confidence.Krishan inspiring Arjuna and cycologically preparing him to receieve the conclusion. Similarly see the good aspects within you and in others around you will develop your self confidence.

Part-3
`mahā-bāho` Krishna sees the good quality within Arjuna. He is praising at this stage just not to flatter him, but he is reminding the good quality within him. Jesus said `Hate the sin, but not the sinner`. When a master sees a person he identifies the good and bad qualities within a person, but he separate the bad quality from the actual person, and guides him to over come those bad quality. 
  The underlying principle is do not hate people because of their bad action they also have other side(good). Yous should identify the bad quality, and not end their, but try to overcome from those bad habit.

`mahā-bāho`  means achiever and dynamic person in life. Arjuna has mastered on thamas and sleep, He has put lot of effort and practise to become no 1 archer. Similarly you have to set your goal and start achieving those goals by doing so only you will become confident. 

what are the qualification to get the higher grace? 
It is not by your birth, how much wealth you have ?, action. It is your inner quality the bhavana `yash ya tasha` who ever you have that maha baho quality wi; get the higher grace.Look within your bhavana (pure intension).

`indriyāṇīndriyārthebhyas` when your communicating you start with something, and end up in something, but when a master communicates he starts
with one point and talks about various things, real life things, crack a joke, but comes to the main point. In verse58 the same `indriyāṇīndriyārthebhyas` he talks about the mastery over senses and he concludes it in verse68. The sadhana principle is in any of your action like speaking, work first determine why i'm doing this ? In the process of getting on with the series of action every action  persay will give incidentel benefit and try to distract you from what you started, but if your a discipline thinker you will not loose the sight of the whole thing.
A person who is a discipline thinker can achieve anything in life. This is called metha sakthi. First start with speaking be discipline while talking about a topic, gradullay bring in the discipline in thoughts, and emotion. In verse58 he says `samharate` (withdrawing) along with `indriyāṇīndriyārthebhyas` he talks of practising withdrawing from senses. here he says `nigṛihītāni` to explain the state of self master
you achieve that when practise.When ever your practise has become effortless state then your established to that state. 

In martial art they do several block practise, over a period of time the blocking from attack will become effortless. They call it muscle brain. 
In life nothing comes without effort. First ask whether you deserve to get what your asking? You get what you deserve first put a consistent effort towards the one you want to achieve.

`samharate` and `nigṛihītāni` both are withdrawal the only difference is `samharte`  means practising, putting consistent effort in doing a particular action and enjoying the effort where as `nigṛihītāni` means state initially its a practise, but as you become advanced the effort will become effortless. The practise will become effortless.

`nigṛihītāni sarvaśhaḥ` means being centered from all side neither indulge not restristained from the sense centers. Decide what you want to become, once decide put your full hearted effort in that. Be a **whole** person everything you do do it fully, more focused for an example  listen to something, eating food.

what is exactly means being in the middle? Its not about the quantity either you are indulge or not indulge in sense objects is doesn't matter its the mind behind the sense center when ever your mind is running behind a sense object or person without your control then your move away from that middle path. 

Once you allowed your mind to indulge in worldly things, you should be in a control to pull back your mind from that sense object once the experience is completed or willingness to pull back. Suppose you have a weakness on a sense object then you may have some rules to pull back. You may ahve rule like not more than 2 sweets here the quantity is also driven by your mind, so its not the quantity, but the mind behind the rule. When it comes to some dangerous worldly aspects like alcohol never ever practise it like i tried some alcohol drinks only 2 pecks because it will put you in trouble in long run.

A sthithapragna person or yogi is always a `nigṛihītāni` he live in the middle . 
- Lord Buddha smiling while a person scoulded him.
- A Japanese martial art master asking his student to come to pracise after he wins the world champion.

Never judge a person who was higher developed than you because externally he or she is indulging, but internally he may be in `nigṛihītāni`. or just because a person withdrawn  externally doesn't mean he is spiritual. Story of a saint and a illreputed lady where in the saint mind became disturbed by her activity.After the died the lady went to heaven and the saint went to hell, because the lady thinking about her activyty and practising the spiritual by praying to the god. The saint was externally mediatating but he always thining about the ladies activity.
