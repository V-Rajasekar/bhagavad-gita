```english
From anger arises delusion. From delusion, confusion of memory.
From confusion of memory, loss of intellect.
From loss of intellect, total destruction.
```

An anger is only an example. Its only one of the modification so somebody who is not short temper, they might have someother modifications like (Fear). 

`bhavati` means arising and becoming (you become one with anger). This is a dangerous stage. Any emotions whether its good or bad as long as its under your control its fine. when it gets out of your control then it becomes dangerous. 

A good emotions like helping others. First earn wealth and increase your capacity to  give money to others. Never exhaust your capacity (e.g) If you have Rs 10, 000 don't give away all the 10,000 because you have exhausted your capacity your no longer in a position to help others.
Instead invest the money and increase your capacity and continuously help others.

An family person should split his earned money in to four parts. 
1. To fullfill his responsibilities and fullfill there dependents needs
2. Saving for future.
3. To enjoy at present
4. A little position to charity and for spiritual journey. May be 10-11%


 मोह is comprised of 6 dimensions(or diseases) of self-deterioration:-  
   
1. Loss of awareness: Awareness is spiritualty and moha is lack of awareness. 
Example: The case of the alcholic who felt that he was still himself even after consuming several pegs. A video recording by his wife of his own behaviour showed him his altered state. Use (abuse) of addictive substances always lead to lack of awareness since they are intoxicants by nature. They shrink one's aura.

2. Delusion: This is the word that has also been used in the translation of the verse. Delusion is disconnection from reality. 
Example: A person might be spooked witnessing the shadow of another person who is standing behind, say, a pillar and not in the line of sight of the first person. The first person perceives the moving shadow of the other person as a ghost when he/she is in a state of delusion. That person is consumed by irrational fear.
As one's consciousness rises, she rises above delusion. Arjuna, here, is also in a state of delusion. In the first chapter, he is appalled to even think of committing the heinous crime of killing wicked people. Krishna through his healing energy and wisdom raises Arjuna from his delusion by the end of the Bhagavad Gita.

3. Ignorance: This is an extension of delusion where the person lacks the wisdom of life. Example: A person believing in superstitions or a wealthy person mistaking people's respect for his clothes and riches as their respect for him. People tend to believe that a 'spiritual' person with a large following is bound to be a true yogi while in stark contrast, the Upanishadic masters hardly had any students.

4. Infatuation: The disease of constantly overrating a person or object.  
Example: A boy infatuated with a girl will be blind to the faults in her. True love is when a person corrects his partner when she is wrong. The fanatical "fans" of celebrities who tend to mimic the celebrity's lifestyle are also in a state of infatuation. Wealth is another classic example of a source of infatuation.

5. Lack of decision making skills: The mind of a person in a state of moha is clouded by delusion. Consequently, such a person lacks the clarity to take the right decisions. It is better to take the counsel of wise people while taking big decisions in life.

6. Pain: A person plagued by moha is in a state of great mental agony. He is so acclimatized to it that he just does not realize it which is a very dangerous state. The master tries to shake the person out of that pain because that person makes no effort to come out of it. 

Buddha was compassionate to the entire humanity because he could understand the states of moha everyone was in. 

Another story that Yogishri said last year that comes to me in this context (it was said in a different context though): When Buddha was giving a discourse to his disciples one day, a stranger came up to him, cursed him and spat in his face. The Buddha remained calm and did not react. All his disciples were furious at that man. The next day, the same man again showed up and this time begged for the Buddha's forgiveness. The Buddha asked whom he should forgive and explained to him that the person who spat on his face the previous day was someone else (someone possessed by anger) while the person asking for forgiveness is someone entirely different.

when you surrender to your guru and to the infinite and practise your sadhana you will not be caught up with moha. 

`smṛiti-vibhramaḥ` is a disease but in that problem itself lies a solution in that word smriti shakthi(increase presence of mind).

`Tip: Increase presence of mind`

```english
when ever you get time start observing what is around you(e.g)things in your living room. Go in details of that observe it in detail and then close your eyes and try to recall this will increase the `smrithi`shathi in you the moha will loose his power in you.

Great monks like Swami Ramakrishna, Vivekananda have practised it.It will give you sharpness and this helps smartness.

`Zen Story`

```language
A master was weighing flax seeds, and a student asked his master what is enlightment ? when do we know a person reached his enlightment stage?

The master said this flax weighs 10 kg.

The deeper message here is live in the presence is the true enlightment state.
