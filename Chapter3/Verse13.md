- All the aspects of our life can be classified into Sattva, Rajas and tamas which will give us tremendous clarity for to assess ourselves for our evolution and growth.
- All of us will have all the three Gunas Sattva, Rajas and Tamas, it will vary in proportions. By doing regular Sadhana we should keep increasing our Tamas to Rajas, Rajas to Sattva and Sattva to Trans Sattva.
- Our real Guna will surface only when we are facing obstacles/challenges and we should be objective, observe and use it for our continuous improvement.
- Sattva is calmness, inner peace, dynamism and external success. Rajas is a combination of internal peace/agitation and external success/failure. 
- In giving and taking the Satvik person’s focus will be always on giving, the Rajasik person’s focus will be biased towards taking and Tamasik person’s focus will be only on taking. 
- `ātma-kāraṇāt` One who cookes for themselve meaning one you act in selfish bhave that is mearly taking the taking the benefit in his act will eat sin meaning they will be agitated(not peaceful).
- We cannot be calculative in all aspects of our life. Everything cannot be business like, our focus particularly in any relationship should be always based on love and affection. In business it can outcome based but in relationships it should always be unconditional love and affection
