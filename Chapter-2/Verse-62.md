When a humanbeing thinks on sense objects.
He gets attached to it. From attachment borns desire
From desire borns anger.

In verse 62 and 63 he describes the ladder of fall. How will you loose mastery over your mind.

Only the humanbeing have the choice of action and not the other creatures in this world, so if a humanbeing's uncontrolled thoughts 
(e.g) without conciousness and fully awarness thinks on sense object it become dangers. First filter your thoughts with full awarness whether its good or bad to him and others. 

The choice of action can lead to evolve or divolve oneself in spirtual life and as well in the material world. If a humanbeing kill someone its called murder there is an karma attach to it and it wil devolve them. where as if an animal kills its prey there is no kara attached, so they don't devolve its there nature.

`dhyāyato` thought could also be a casual thought which is quite dangers.(e.g) A Drug addicted person takes drugs casually then lose themselves.

`vishayan` sense objects which gives information from the world, so since as a humanbeing you have this natural urge to explore the mind will go on it own and try to gather information from the world. You can't stop it then what could we do ?

Using my choice of action I can direct the mind to those objects which can give you positive informations, but if I try to cut off this exploratory nature of the mind then your stifling the very nature of the mind such person will not go he/she will stunt (e.g) bonzai tree doesn't grow if there roots are cut off.

why mind goes on its own? It is inorder to gather information about that object 
why is it mind want to gather information? that is the very natural urge of mind to explore and gain knowledge its like other urges (hunger, thirsty) which you can't be stopped.
`dhyāyato` the other dimension of it's casual thinking. Casual thinking comes when you get boredom, when mind doesn't find anything interesting
it gets boredom, or when you don't enjoy your life. This boredom may lead to overeating, addiction towards sense objects(watching TV), drugs. 

How to avoid boredom ?
- Follow your swadharma that is do which is interested to enjoyable to you
- Enjoy simple actions in our daily day to day lifes ( Brushing your teeth, Bathing, Drinking water, cooking and eating)
- When work is enjoyable that work will start giving relaxation.
- Go in-depth in your field like reading and understanding  the basics in your field. 
If you practise the above mind will never get boredom if you stop this mind will start finding other avenues to overcome boredom like casual thinkings. 

`dhyāyato` 3rd dimension is calling to mind (recall) after an experience the mind has the tendency to call back the object if this happens without your awareness again your _frittering_ away your energies. 
The more recalling the things in mind it develops attachment addiction and further produces more negativity. 
when you recall some in your past with awareness is fine. In scriptures never said don't think about past and future and live in present it's infact

`Don't be worry about the past and don't be anxious about future.`

when does mind recall (go back to object again and again) when ever you con
