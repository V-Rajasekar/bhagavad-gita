विहाय कामान्य: सर्वान्पुमांश्चरति नि:स्पृह: |
निर्ममो निरहङ्कार: स शान्तिमधिगच्छति || 71||

vihāya kāmān yaḥ sarvān pumānśh charati niḥspṛihaḥ
nirmamo nirahankāraḥ sa śhāntim adhigachchhati

That person, who having abandoned all desires,
moves about without craving, without the sense of mineness,
without ego, attain peace.
```

In verse 70, Lord Krishna was referring to the internal state of a Sthitha Pragnya. Now he is talking about how a Sthitha Pragnya acts in the world.

The Kama mentioned in Verse 71 by Lord Krishna is the uncontrolled desire. Charathi is moving or acting. The significance of Charathi with Shanthi is to break the misconception within me that action or effort leads to loss of peace  Instead of thinking external activities reduce my internal peace, think strong peace within me influences the outside world.

In this verse and several other times in Chapter 2, Lord Krishna uses the combination yaha" and "saha" or "yasya" and "thasya". *Whoever does the things mentioned, that person will become a Sthitha Pragnya. We strongly believe that only some divine people can become enlightened. This is due to our conditioning in this life and previous births. Yogishri gave the story of a tiger cub which had been brought up by deer and kept thinking it was one of them. When a tiger came to hunt all the deer, this tiger ran with the rest of the deer. The hunting tiger caught this tiger and took it to a pond and showed their images and said "Look, we are the same. You are a tiger". We are like the tiger thinking we are a deer due to all of our impressions and conditioning. Swayam Prakashith.
