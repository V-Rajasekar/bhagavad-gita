> तानि सर्वाणि संयम्य युक्त आसीत मत्पर: |  
वशे हि यस्येन्द्रियाणि तस्य प्रज्ञा प्रतिष्ठिता || 61||

> *tāni sarvāṇi sanyamya yukta āsīta mat-paraḥ  
vaśhe hi yasyendriyāṇi tasya prajñā pratiṣhṭhitā*

*Having restrained them all, one should
sit united with Me as the supreme. One's wisdom is indeed
established whose senses are under control.* 

In this sentence he talks about the three words **thani sarvani sanyamya** it can be translated roughly as "restrain them all (the senses)" that would be a very simplistic translation. Here all the senses are the 10 senses(5 external sense organs and their actions)

**Signifiance of Thaani Sarvaani**
The **first signifiance** of the phrase Thaani Sarvaani is as follows.  "checking or restraining that is something is flowing you just slow it down*"
When water leaks from a bottle with ten holes, all ten holes have to be plugged before water stops leaking. Likewise we have to master all of our senses not just one or some of them.

The  **second signifiance**  "*completely stopping*" when you know your lossing your control or consciousness in one sense enjoyment its  the time to stop completely.When ever your trying to apply this wisdom in one area and conserve the energy remember the ego will be waiting to redirect the mind to other channels.

For example, over-eating could be due to suppression of pleasure from other senses. Similarly, when we shout at a spouse, it may be totally unrelated to them and due to a suppression in another area, e.g., office work.

 Even weakness in one sense organ will put us down, so get control over all the sense organs.Self control is not mere physical withdrawal, Its withdrawal from sense centres of the mind
 
 **Solution to the problem of Mastering the senses**
 The solution is not to deny the sense pleasures. This will only lead to frustration.The solution is sadhana through Yoga Sankirtan and following the principles behind the beautiful word sumyamya . This word is a sandhi of two words sum + yum (intense + restrain) and is also pronounced as sayyamya .
 
**The Three Dimensions of Sayamya**
	1. "*check or restrain*". When we are contacting the sense objects, e.g., eating a sweet, we should restrain if we find ourselves losing control.  
	2. "*Completely stopping*"If our consciousness is totally lost in the sense pleasure and we are out of control completely, we have to stop the experience immediately.  Mere stopping might pent up the frustration and burt out some other area like over eating. anger, so do Sadhana.
	3. "yum" which is "ayama" which means "to extend". In this case, this refers to extending the sense contact. For example, pranayama means to extend the prana. Note this also means restrain to the prana as the word "yam" mysteriously also happens to be inside the word "ayama".
	4. 

- sanyamya (sayamya- sum+yum) yum means restrain and sum totally. The word yum has 3 dimensions 
		1. checking or restraining that is something is flowing you just slow it down
		2.  completely stopping (stop and do sadhana) otherwise the frustration pent up and burst out some other area like anger, over eating.
		4. yam also represents double(twin) yam means to restrain,  ayam means to stretch out at physical level allowing the sense organs to contact the sense objects. (only) where you don't have any weakness. 

Mastering Sayamya - Knowing when to contact, when to restrain and when to stop it  w.r.t to all the senses. 
when you start practising Sayamya your consciousness move from external senses to the sense centers of mind. you will enjoy everything in life, but also detached. 
Sayamya and meditation(Sadhana) compliments each other, when you practise sayamya it gives focus to sit and meditate and mediation gives energy to practise sayamya.
