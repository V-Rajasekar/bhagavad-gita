        प्रसादे सर्वदु:खानां हानिरस्योपजायते |
        प्रसन्नचेतसो ह्याशु बुद्धि: पर्यवतिष्ठते || 65||

    prasāde sarva-duḥkhānāṁ hānir asyopajāyate
    prasanna-chetaso hyāśhu buddhiḥ paryavatiṣhṭhate

`In peace there arises the destruction of one's sorrows in totality.
Indeed(when) the mind in tranquil, the intellect quicky becomes firm.`

Verse 65 gives the motivation to practise the spirtual path and do sadhana.When you understand the value fully who will automatically motivate yourself and practise the priniciples/sadhana. The purification is an infinite process day after day so you need tremendous motivation to continue the sadhana.

When peace arises it will destroy the sorrow in totality, here totality means both the quality and quantity. It will remove the seeds of the sorrow and continue to be in peace and calm mind. Along with the peace arise no sorrow, and stress this is you call as happiness.

The peace and no stress arises at times when you fullfile your desires. When you a have desire to buy a car or job you are in the state of excitement(fullfillment) or fear of anxity (not fullfillment) whether you will get that or not, you are in fear of losing it. But when you get the car or job you become peaceful and all the stress which you experienced before the fullfillment goes away. You feel by getting the car you feel you will be on a state of no agitation

In life the reason why the mind is running after so many things is the quest for happiness . You seek wealth, name and fame to become happy. Seeking wealth, name and fame are only the tools to clam your own mind. Unless and until you understand it you can never ever over come the greed which you have on it. 

Why you should be happy by acquiring the object in the world? Everything you do some action inorder to become happy will not let you to be happy for long time. First get into the state of happiness

```language

    Every time you fullfill your desire the sorrow is destroyed but it again arises. First get into the state of happiness and then when you contact the world when you do things in the world when you acquire things in the world your every action will be then an expression of peace, happiness.You will be happy with or without object (e.g) when you do action with the expression of happiness and not inorder to become happiness it creates happiness. 

```

you will do your sadhana or habit when you find the value in it. If you don't find it you will loose the motivation to do over a period of time. Think about waking by earling in the morning doing the yogasankithan and kriyas. 
If you ask your child to do a thing forcefully the child does it without full heart because she has no other choice since she/he is little once they growup they will skip, only if you teach them the value they will continue to do.

`sarva-duḥkhānāṁ hānir` All sorrow is destroyed. hanihi means destruction.The different dimensions of `hanihi`

1. `Damage`  The intensity of stress and agitation will reduce, Also the frequency starts reducing.
2. `Decrease` The quantity of the agitation reduce from 10 to 9,8,7...
3. `Abandonment` When the stress, agitation quantity, frequency reduces then you develop objectivity (ignore) the capacity to give it up, Once you develop the third dimension You will not leave any business unfinished. You will not carry any hangup. if a person comes and scolds you speak to the person and resolve it then and there, once you develop the objectivity you create a shield around you internal security. 

You will have 2 way security system one is internal security which is objectivity, second externally also you will learn to speak for yourself.  All the things which bothering you while sleeping by doing yoga sangeethan sadhana it release all the negative energy. Its not the external issues affects you rather its the lack of internal shield that allows you to come and bother issue.
4. `Absence` The sorrow itself will not be present, then there is no point of destruction.

The shakti of yogi is not only remembering everything *memory power* but also capcaity to forget things which he wants to forget. when an experience is negative however much you want to forget it keep haunting your mind, so that dimension of abandonment is a great a power. The sadhana is the solution for abanding the negative experience and let go of those negative experience.

Self realisation is a long term process. Some self realization themselfs in couple of months or years depending up on their karmas and the sadhana they practise but indeed it will happen.

`When the mind is tranquile the intellect quickly become firm `
A person has to have both the purity of mind and clarity of the mind. Krishna says develop the purity of mind and then intellect will also quickly become clarity. If a person only has the clarity then he use it for selfish purpose (e.g) Shaguni.
A person only having purity of mind will be fooled by others (e.g) Yuthastria

There are 3 stages to the clamness and sharpness of mind
1. `Unreactive mind`(thamasick) An unreactive mind could be being (Nothinging) lazy or very stubborn to his idea. In the first stage you will not have motivation to do your sadhana
2. `Agitative mind` Your thinking become little confused and you start getting lot of doubts and questions. Don't be afraid Express your doubts
3. `Calm mind` (sathvik) A mind in state of calmness. Externally both stage 1 and Stage 3 are looks same. The difference b/w this 2 stages is a person who is in calm mind he fully understand what you are saying and let it go where as in stage 1 unreactive mind he is intellectually sleeping. 
   -    He will not philosophize unnecessarily 
   -    His decision make is quick and clear way
   -    Very pleased and delighted and very pleasant personality

`A person who develops purity and make his/her mind calm and   also the intellect is sharp can achieve anything in the life.`
How some people are agitated but they are still successful? Because there successful is relativly higher to others because of some kind of focus they do or because of their previous karma.

` prasanna-chetaso` prasanna means tranquility calmness of mind. The second dimension also means being pleased, being delighted. You can become very pleased person to others only when you pleased by yourself. 
Begin pleased with own self comes from uniqueness of one self. Do not compare yourself with others. Every person has a uniqueness your the part of the entire cosmos. A forest filled with trees and river, a desert both have their unqiue beauty. 

The moment you start comparing with others you move away from ` prasanna-chetaso` and you become more agitated rather than peaceful. 

what is separating you from the cosmos it is your own ego. when you drop your ego the dividing line drawn by the ego disappears.

the third dimension of prasanna means when something is _propitiated_ when something is sooothened, or pacifying something is we are talking about something which is agitiated. Here its the restless mind.

Pickup things which will soothen your mind. like TV program, music, food, colours.

prasana also means working for others welfare. when you truly thing about the welfare of others person those vibrations will come million times more with more blessings, so being kind to other is not weak quality that doesn't mean you neglect yourself 
when ever you interacting to others try to do service making other people happy. Always be kindness to other.

when you always think in terms of others welfare now you will grow automatically others. 
- If you help peoples to achieve their goals you will achieve your goals because you receive help from others.

By practising the above principle your aura expands and you become peaceful, calm mind and sharp intellect and then he says 
`buddhiḥ paryavatiṣhṭhate` follwing are the dimensions
1. the intellect becomes firm to make good decision. 
2. Your intellect should be very steady. once who have a fixed  goal you have to practise it steadly. the more steady your in life you will be more successful.
3. Expanding and filling the intellect. The intellect role is discriminating things like its black and its white. By sadhana
your thinking become so deep and subtle to differentiate what is permanent and impermanent? what will give you happiness?
Don't restrict yourself attach to religion, cast because your love will be restricted to those boundaries.
