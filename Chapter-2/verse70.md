He continues the character of a person Sthithapragnya in this verse. The Ocean remains unmoved as the water enters from different direction, in such a way in whom all the objects of desire entire, not the desirer of object that person remains peace. The most important facet of Sthithapragnya is peace and its covered in the verse 70 and 71. Everything we do today is to attain peace, happiness.

We try to acquire different things in our life externally, however, in acquiring many things , we are seeking only one thing and that is happiness and peace. These external objects that we try to get is for our internal peace/happiness"
The goals in our life can be divided into three parts -
1) External - the objects that we acquire from the world
2) Subtler aspects - acquiring skills that requires both external help and internal effort
3) Spiritual growth - That is completely from within oneself. Inner transformation - bringing a change in oneself
To be in a state of Sthithapragnya is to be established in the higher wisdom eternally

`Sadhana:` Try to penetrate your own mind to find out what your seeking? Going deep your own action, emotion, You are currently seeking many things right now like wealth, health and relationship. But in all the seeking you ultimately seek is peace.

__Oct 10, 2021__

Don’t let my preconceived notions limit my experiences. Don’t impose restrictions on my life or on others. Be aware when I see myself doing this and pull myself back to an open minded state like a baby.

Though there are many different Gods, the infinite is only one. The forms are a way we focus our energy instead of the formless reality

You go through different experience in the life, but at the end what your are seeling is peace and happiness. The mind is under ilussion that it seeking manythings in life. You cannot draw line on how much many money you want? How much you want to have the sense enjoyment? You cannot draw a line because the mind is under illusion what ever your getting is less? and you have to get more.

`sa śhāntim āpnoti na kāma-kāmī` meaning of this line. 
`If your very clear with what your seeking is peace it doesn't matter how much you have, you will feel peaceful`, if your more caught up with that illusion, you will not be peaceful, but don't stop from acquiring wealth, don't become thamas, but bring this clarity that where you want to go.

What gives the Power to a Sthitha Pragnya when an individual is transformed to a Sthitha Pragnya? The Power comes from Shanthi or inner peace.

Most people lead mechanical lives. We are caught up in our daily activities and so enmeshed in them that we don't have the time to question why we are doing an activity. "Yoga Maya" puts an illusion over us and we are robbed of our time and before we know it 20-30-40 years have passed. As Adi Shankara says "kala kreedathi gachhat ..." - time sports with us and eons pass. How to break this? Put in the effort to become aware and request the Guru Shakthi. Be deep and refined in every action. Do it deeply or don't do it at all. Goals give direction to our actions.

As we go about various activities in life, even though the activities are different, they are all performed with the same ultimate goal, to obtain peace. A purposeful action is that which achieves the goal. If we acquire wealth or a relationship and that causes us stress, it isn't purposeful. Instead if it is done in a way that gives us peace, that action is purposeful and will help us, even though that peace is temporary, because we will be more calm during personal Sadhana which gives us the permanent inner peace. Lord Krishna says later that all of us have to act; we cannot not act. What the great Yogis figured out was that if we perform any action while being aware that we are doing it to obtain peace, we will automatically do it in a way that results in peace. We will also seek objects and perform actions (how we speak, think, feel and act) that reduce agitation and bring us peace.

Just as an ocean is unmoved by the waters that enter it from all quarters, so does one obtain peace in whom the objects of desire enter, not the desirer of objects .

Samudra refers to the ocean. The quality of the ocean is Paripoorna . Poorna is complete and Paripoorna is being completely complete, complete in all dimensions. The divine aspect of Paripoorna is also illustrated in the Maha Shiva Dhyana and in the Eesa Vashya Upanishad. That which it came from is complete and Infinite. That which came from it is complete and Infinite. That which is left over is complete and Infinite. We feel that we are incomplete and hence seek to "complete" ourself. I am already Paripoorna completely complete.

All gods are divine energies within us that we have not tapped yet. Ganesha represents the energy of success. Goddess Lakshmi is said to come from the ocean when being churned and represents not just wealth but every type of abundance - wealth, relationships, etc. But the secret mystery behind Goddess Lakshmi is that she also represents inner abundance. As an aspiring Yogi, focus on achieving the external abundance by recognizing that it is a manifestation of the inner abundance. The Upanishads describe the path of evolution and devolution. Dharma leads to Kama (in this case Ichha) which leads to Bhoga which leads to Moksha. Adharma leads to kama (uncontrolled desire) that leads to Aasakthihi (attachment) which leads to adhogathi (destruction). In the very middle of the Gita in the 9th chapter, Krishna says "Yoga kshemam". Here yoga refers to internal happiness and kshemam refers to external happiness or bhoga. Lord Krishna says focus on "me" (here, the Infinite) and you will get both internal and external happiness.

The feeling of gratitude makes us appreciate our Paripoorna.

Sadhana homework:
Every morning, express gratitude to the Supreme, the Guru and other holy masters, parents, spouse, children, friends. As we feel more grateful, we feel more whole.

__Oct 24, 2021__

- An imperfect mind projects its imperfection on the other person, more so on a Sthitapragya. Never judge a saint, a sthitapragya, it is a bad karma. 
- An imperfect mind cannot project the state of a Sthitapragya. The only way to know the depth of the ocean is by getting into the ocean. The only way to understand what a sthitapragya is by becoming a Sthitapragya

- When in the deep ocean, the only way to experience the entire ocean is when we let the ocean engulf us, and that's when the "I" becomes invisible and we merge into the deep ocean of the Infinite presence. 

- A Sthitapragya may externally look different but deep within he/she experiences the Infinite peace which stays Achala (without any movement, or without any disturbance). 

- All 24 avatars of Lord Vishnu look different externally, but the inner state of the peace of every avatar is always the same, unaltered. Lord Krishna, despite of the external challenges, he is always with a smile, with that bliss and happiness. 

- Staying in the state of Paripoorna brings in that peace. A Sthitapragyna experiences a state of peace even after removing the object of desire, and that state remains unaltered from before the acquisition of the object of desire (kaama).  

- Stop depending on the world for your happiness. It is not being said to stop being in the world, without which it is impossible for our existence. We should stop "depending" on the world for our happiness. 

- Peace is already something within. It is not acquired/achieved from anything external. 
- Examples of Lord Vishnu's concert being Maa Laxmi, and Shiva's concert being Parvati were depicted for the sake of a story, but each form of the Infinite itself was Paripoona with itself. They were complete in their own form already. 

- Similarly, Peace is already within us. We have inherited from that Infinite. Peace is our birth right. When we observe our own actions, whatever we do, we do it to get Peace eventually. 

Sadhana tip:
-----------------
Anything you do, do it with peace, cheer, happiness and bliss...

__Oct 31, 2021__

The purpose of the verses by Lord Krishna is self-improvement. The action of going deeply within every verse through the Yogic approach also teaches us to be deep in everything in life. Identify the cause for a situation where I need to improve (e.g., being timely) through deep introspection instead of automatically first looking for solutions. Be deep 

Spirituality doesn't mean running away from the experiences or challenges. People are in one of two extremes, either over-attachment or running away. Our goal is to experience everything the world has to offer and remain peaceful. Our ultimate goal is to be a Sthitha Pragnya. Both a Sthitha Pragnya and anybody else have the peace within. The Sthitha Pragnya experiences it. A Sthitha Pragnya can be from any culture, place, religion, etc. Meditation is a simple process of going within. Through impressions over births and births, we have forgotten it. Going deeper into meditation means going deeper into oneself. Through the Yogic approach, the Master revealed the divine meaning of the word Aapnothi. Aapnothi means to experience. When Lord Krishna says sa shanthi aapnothi he means Go inward to experience the peace instead of outward seeking the peace . When we look for peace outwards as a Kama kami, the objects of desire disturb our peace. Instead if we do Aapoorya mana achala pratishtham Samudra , we expand our consciousness through Sadhana and let the objects of desire enter us like the waters enter an ocean from all quarters.

The Samudra or ocean has waves at the top and is completely calm deep within. Likewise, at our surface we are agitated by whatever the world offers but in reality we are at peace deep within. Experience the peace instead of seeking the peace.

Prathistham refers to the process of getting more and more established as we go deeper. There are two ways of thinking about this. If we associate with the physical body, we are deeply affected by everything that happens to the body. Next if we go deeper inward (similar to going deeper into the ocean) and associate ourselves with the pranic body, we become more established and we relate to everything about the Pranic body. Next as we go deeper inward into the mano maya kosha (the emotional body), we become more established. Next the wisdom body, then bliss body, then jeeva atma and then Paramatma. Another way of approaching this is to consider the five bodies to all be present next to each other. We can go deep within any one body (symbolically go deeper from the surface of the ocean) and reach the Infinite. For example, during Kaya Tatva empowerment meditation, Yogishri made us go deep within the physical body to the subatomic level and beyond. Thus the Infinite is there within everything if we go deep within since the Infinite is present everywhere. For this reason, in fact, peace is not just within us, it is an aspect of us. Tat tvam asi Aham brahmasmi

Turn the direction of seeking inward

The Puranas are full of stories such as the one where Veda Vyasa requests Ganesha to write the Mahabharatha while he dictates. In response to Ganesha's condition that he continuously dictate (a phenomenal task considering the Mahabharatha is 4 lakh verses, of which 1 lakh verses are known to us), Vyasa put the counter-condition that Ganesha shouldn't write anything he doesn't understand. This automatically made Ganesha contemplate each verse in depth which gave Vyasa time to compose the next verse. When Vinayaka began writing, he broke one of his tusks to use it. The deep meaning of this is as follows. The two tusks represent the opposites in life, e.g., joy and sorrow, heat and cold, etc. We are always swinging between these two extremes. Ganesha's breaking the task represents the act of not going to the extremes and being in the center. So Ganesh is referred to as Dvandhva Atheeta, one who is beyond the two extremes.

Sadhana Tip
Expand my consciousness through sadhana and let all of life's experiences enter me fully. I am the peaceful deep ocean.

Objectively do the Sadhana
Our personal Sadhana makes us aware of the impurities that have come out. We notice our ego more, not because our ego has increased but because we become more aware of our ego. As we become more aware, don't stop the efforts and continue doing the Sadhana with objectivity.

__Nov 7, 2021__

The Bhagavad Gita is beautifully constructed. The first chapter and the first dozen or so verses of the second chapter are presented to first outline the problem at hand, namely, Arjuna's sorrow. To resolve anything, we first need to become aware of our problem. Then Lord Krishna begins with inspiring verses to first uplift Arjuna because he isn't a mental state to listen to any advice. As Arjuna inquires about the qualities of a Sthitha Pragnya, Lord Krishna goes into depth on this question because becoming a Sthitha Pragnya is what we want, whether we realize it or not.

When Shri Rama Thirtha was asked why are people greedy, he replied "Why not?". He said, "Everyone is seeking the Infinite. When they don't get it from the finite, they want more and more." At some point, everyone's search turns inwards. What is the difference between a Sthitha Pragnya and another person when it comes to God. A Sthitha Pragnya has realized that he is part of the Infinite whereas we haven't yet realized it. Our initial goal should be to be a Sadhak. A Sadhak has realized that his goal is the Infinite while a Sthitha Pragnya is Self-Realized and has realized that the Self is part of the Infinite. Initially, we seek to merge with the Infinite but actually the Infinite actually opens itself to us with Sadhana.

Lord Krishna later describes Sakama and Nishkama. The first is to perform spiritual practice to attain a common goal like health, wealth etc, and stopping or stagnating with that. Nishkama is to have the goal of going inward to merge with the Infinite. Along the way, you attain all worldly goals too, but keep in mind the main goal.

Another dimension of Aapoorya Maanam was revealed by the Master. We have to experience the world from all quarters fully to progress spiritually. Mumukshatva is the desire to be liberated from the finite. It doesn't mean running away from the world as you have to experience the external world fully so as not to be agitated when you are in the inward journey. 

As we do Sadhana and we become more aware of our areas to improve, one may question whether one can become a Sthitha Pragnya as we experience agitations and self-doubt. But remember that it is only a deep ocean that experiences waves not a shallow body of water, so experiencing the surface waves of agitation is itself a sign of the depth within like a Samudra . Self-doubt is a hindrance to spiritual progress. Be self-confident like Sita Devi became after seeing Rama's ring offered by Hanuman.

Sage Valmiki used to be a highway robber called Ratnakar who robbed and murdered people. Sage Narada visited him recognizing that he was ready for the higher empowerment and asked him why is committing these sins to which he replied it was to help his family. Ratnakar tied Narada to a tree and demanded his money. Narada said he only had his Veena that he used to sing the glories of the Lord. Ratnakar refused to believe him. Narada touched his third eye and gave him the first empowerment. Ratnakar internally saw the baggage of his karmas, the sins, and on Narada's suggestion, asked his family members if they would accept the consequences of his actions, to which they all said no. Ratnakar realized the folly of his actions and made his way back to the Sage with haste and fear, and falling at his feet, asked him what he could do. Narada gave him the second empowerment, the divine mantra of Ram and asked him to repeat it. The baggage of his sins was so much that Ratnakar could only say Mara (what he used to shout after killing people). Narada said that's okay, repeat Mara with the Bhavana of Ram. It is Bhavana that matters. Withing a few times, Mara became Rama, Rama, Rama. Ratnakar became the great Sage Valmiki who composed the Ramaya.

The Master gave this story to illustrate that if a person like Ratnakar can become a Sthitha Pragnya like Sage Valmiki,  why do we have to doubt our capabilities? Use the power of choice and self-effort to remember that the fact that we have agitations means that we have the depth within us and to use self-effort to explore the ocean with regular Sadhana and the grace of the Guru.

__Nov 14, 2021__

Valmiki’s story teaches us important lessons:

No matter who or what you are and what external wealth etc you possess or what sins you have accumulated – these are not factors that either guarantee or reduce your eligibility for spiritual ascension. Instead, the major determinants of spiritual progress  are :

   1.	Your sincere efforts
   2.	Purity of Heart
   3.	Possessing the Right Bhavana

The most precious gift one can aspire for in this human life is the attainment of Peace.  A sthitha pragnya is one who is established in the Peace of the Infinite- Deep seated in the Infinite Within!

A non- sthitha pragnya and sthitha pragnya are not two different people, instead it is a phase of transition from non-sthitha pragnya to sthitha pragnya for which one has to journey within and find the Peace that emanates from the Infinite within!

A sthitha pragnya which is a potential possibility in each one of us is compared to an Ocean!  On the surface of the ocean there are waves while deep within is the stillness, quiet and peace of the Ocean. The waves are likened to the expression of an individual while contacting the world.
The three aspects of Peace that an ocean depicts which are found in a sthitha pragnya are:

   1.	A sthitha pragnya is at peace with himself, he is neither bored nor agitated when he is left in solitude. 
   2.	He is at peace even while contacting the world.  The waves that are seen are superficial and represent the turbulence caused by the people and circumstances in real life, but they actually do not affect him.  He contacts the world and executes his responsibilities without being agitated by the realities that confront him, either in the form of people or in the form of different circumstances.  
   3.	He is deep-rooted in the peace of the Infinite within him and he emanates peace which can be felt in his surroundings. The peace from within him spreads to his surroundings.

The Sadhana tips are – we need to be calm and `learn to enjoy and accept our own company` when in solitude see what is the good and bad things you did or happen to you it will be like seeing a moving where in you will see the mix of comedy, drama, horror all will be there, When the mind is free from agitations, one enjoys peace even when left in solitude.  

Second- `when your operating in the world what is the level of peace?` How much of spiritual energy are you carrying and maintaining when you contact the world? through your medidation you can maintain the spirtual energy and peace.

Third `How are you interacting in the world? How is your expression? How others feel your company?` when an individual is established in the Peace of the Infinite, then he emanates peace which fills his surroundings and all those who come in contact within him.  Just as the coolness of the air is felt in the beach way before one approaches the sea so also the peace emanating from the sthitha pragnya can be felt in his surroundings.

we need to accept people and situations as they are.Acceptance should be a choice and stem as a show of strength and should never be acceptance due to inability.Acceptance is the first step and it is a mental attitude. When you dont accept people or situation then you start expecting unrealistic expectation,when you assess people then you confirm the reality of the lifes. Work without expectation, but it doesn't mean don't have expectation, all it means is your expectation should be align with the reality, so when your reality of life and expectation are mismatched then it cause stress.
You have no control over others, but you have control over the expectation. How to deal with the person ? How to act and speak with the person? find a solution. Remember a yogi doesn't complain people he always think how to handle the person or situation. if you start complaining then 

when you join the samdidhram and sadhna you get these three powerful steps number one when your all alone by yourself creating spiritual energy, second when your contacting the world being so much established in the spiritual energy and it never reduces finally the postive expression you eminate makes others around you feel comfortable.

Sadhana tip- Practice acceptance of people and situations and take the right measures to resolve the problems that occur. 
Unacceptance or expectations that do not match with reality lead to stress and loss of peace.

__Nov 21, 2021__

A Sthitha Pragnya is like an ocean, all-accepting. Based on our belief systems, we put boundaries around ourselves and accept only those who conform to our beliefs. Spirituality is not a religion, following a certain God or practicing certain beliefs. It is being limitless.

A Mumukshu is someone who is on a quest to get answers to fundamental questions such as the purpose of my birth and death, how did the world get created and is there someone guiding this. The intense desire to be liberated from the finite is Mumukshatva. A sadhak fulfils this desire through Sadhana. In fact, the Mumukshatva will not let a Sadhak sleep until he or she finds answers to these questions. The answers to the questions cannot be got by reading any number of scriptures, that is merely an intellectual pursuit. It is instead an inner journey and a Guru comes into our life to show the way. The guidance provided is at the wavelength of the student (just like a teacher teaches first and third grade students differently although the teacher feels the same towards both of them) and the nature of the guidance sought - physical, emotional, mental, or Infinite. The Master indicates all the worldly benefits that will be obtained through spiritual practice to motivate the student to continue the Sadhana, but only the Sadhak who seeks the Infinite gets the Infinite.

Being all accepting like the Samudra is at the mental level not at the action level. It doesn't mean being passive and influenceable (like Yudisthira during the dice game). It means we assess the qualities of a person clearly but do not judge. By separating the quality from the person, we are able to relate to the other person more and calm our mind and act productively. It is one thing to worry about or be affected by my action, but why be affected by another's action? 

There are three aspects to all-acceptance: 
Accept the other person as he or she is  
Accept the objects as it is
Accept the situation as it is

There is a difference between assess and judge. Assessing someone is assesing the quality if a person has negative quality then first assess their good and bad quality, but don't judge and relate yourself to have a good relationship with that person. When you judge a person then you start complaining, but when you assess and know that person is rude, then you will think about how to talk to this person and have a smooth relationship.

When we accept a person as he or she is, we separate the quality from the person. The negative quality is only like a disease and is not the person itself. We don't hate or judge a person because of a disease, we empathize with them. (While listening to Yogishri, I become aware of a "disease" I have and how I don't want people to judge me as a person based on what I say). Judging a person prevents us from being able to relate to them. Only if we relate, can we assist. Having this attitude leads to unconditional love. With a son, be relatable and friendly, don't give advice. In chapter 12, Krishna lists the gunas of a Bhakta: The first is not hating anybody and the second is being a friend to all!

Sadhana homework: Identify one or two specific instances in each of the above three categories of all-acceptance for me and reflect.

Wish good for another person, but don't try to materialize for another person. You are interfering with their Karma and that soul's agenda and also it can have a negative effect on you. Don't do Sadhana for another person, i.e., don't visualize a benefit for that person during your personal Sadhana. Instead help them through action. Sadhana is a personal practice. Set goals for oneself (which can include my relationship with others) and materialize them through Sadhana. Progress inwardly towards the Infinite. Doing Sadhana benefits seven generations before and after.

The Sthithapragnya in you is unfolded in three levels, using samudhram (a drop from the ocean)
1. The first level (drop considering itself as separate from the ocean) is you think you are separate from the infinite. when you're at this level think each and everyone as finite.
2. Second level(drop considering itself as a part of the ocean)  you consider as a part of the infinite.(I'm yours, a direct relationship with the god)
3. Third level(drop consider i'm  the ocean) where you become Sthithapragnya

When Lord Rama asked Hanuman how he viewed him, he said: At the physical level, I view me as different from you. At the jiva level, I view me as part of you. At the Atma level, I view us as the same. This is the same philosophy of Dvaita, Vishishtadvaita and Advaita expounded by the self-realized masters, Ramanujacharya, Madhwacharya and Shankaracharya, respectively. They were saying this to different audiences and hence each propounded a certain path. One should practice all three.

when ever you face a challenge let us say somebody insult you do a deep breathing(breath through nose and exhale from mouth) connect with the guru sakthi, the energy of the great master will help you to overcome the situation. When you practise this exercise then you become a state of calm, and peace and choose the positive action. You will get the power to choose the responses.

As the ocean remains unmoved (achala) there are three dimension on achala. achala is the opposite of the chala, the basic nature of chala is 
trembling, unsteady, frail

1. Achala means free from agitation. Maintaining clamness
2. It means focus. steady, maintain self improvement.
3. It means very very strong. When ever something goes wrong outside, immeditely your mind get agitated, you loss you focus, your strength you become chala and start putting effort, the opposite tool available is achala 

You can practise achala only when you formulate goals, create and follow the schedules otherwise the time will pass and your spiritual energy will erode.

__Dec12_2021__

**Three dimensions of achala**
- Being calm and not agitated
- Being focused and not fickle minded
- Being strong and not frail

Peace is one of the most important facet of a stitha prajna, by obtaing peace from within a person tends to get a lot of clarity. But when we talk of peace for now it is just temporary, it may be due to the circumstance or any other reason we may feel peace in a time bound manner. But the great masters have said that it is not that one feels peace in a peaceful situation which determines his spiritual growth, but he is said to be attained peace when he goes through the test if various situation and still be able to retain the peace which he experiences during the meditation. The Yogis called this pratishtam, which means establishment in peace.

Keep doing Sadhana until you get Prathistham (established). The Master gave the wonderful story of Parasurama, the Ansh Avatar of Lord Narayana. Parasurama set about destroying unrighteous kings but found he had very little peace after this. He approached a yogi and asked him to be his guru and show him how to obtain peace.
The yogi said "I can't be your guru". 
"Then who"? 
"Bhagawan Datatreya"!
Parasurama approached Bhagawan Datatreya and was initiated into several truths including Srividya. Then he meditated and found he was very peaceful. But as soon as he opened his eyes, he found he was distracted. He asked the Bhagawan how to stay connected with the Infinite, the Master said you need to do the Sadhana till you get ***achala pratishtam.***

when your is attached to a object or person an he/she constantly thinking about it is called focus. what is the true test of focus?
Focus is our ability to place our mind or withdraw it from any object/ situation consciously (by choice).when you channelize your mind concisously to a object or person is called focus, and not allowing the mind run on his own.

when some challenges comes in your life check how strong are you? Have you taken any responsibility and continue to be strong when any challenges comes in your life after taking a responsibility

`kāmā yaṁ praviśhanti sarve
        sa śhāntim āpnoti na kāma-kāmī`

**How will a kamakami function?**
The word kamaha means desires and the objects of desire.
Kamaha means desire and kami means the person who desires.
We Should be able to differentiate between kama and ichcha.
Kama comes from agitations and ichcha comes from state of peace.
If desire doesn't get fulfilled, kamakami will get frustrated. He will become more stressed and lose his peace.

**How does a sthithapragnya function?**
A sthithapragnya generates desire for functional purposes. 
Icha come from peace or without disturbing the peace
He is in a perfect state of peace. He generated thoughts towards an object consciously.
Whether or not the objects remain with him, he is in a state of peace always.
If his desire doesn't get fulfilled also, he will not be frustrated because he understands that nothing is permanent and life has to move on. He will see the next best option available.
 
Both these aspects are within us. Some desires are kamaha and some are ichcha.
To the extent we are agitated our desire is kamaha. To the extent we are peaceful,  our desire is ichcha.
The whole sadhana is to come out of the clutches of kamaha. We should not become a slave to our desires.

The great masters have said throw away the Kamaha(desires), they doesn't mean the icha shakthi

**How do we master our stress?**
The root cause of stress is Kamakami (the desire coming out of agitation) then How do master the stress is
by converting our kamaha into ichcha.
If anything is agitating us, we need to do a bit of analysis as to what is the desire that is agitating us.
Doing sadhana will help us to convert that kamaha to ichcha.

__Dec19_2021__

The path to become a sthithapragna is moving from kamakami towards Sthithapragna. Its same as moving from desirer of object to
peace. A Kamakami is a slave to desire and objects of desires. A ordinary person experience following things in life sense enjoyment,
emotions, and desire to acquire worldly things be it a object, person, wealth, name and fame. 

When this desire for sense enjoyment, wealth, name and fame goes beyond your control you became a slave and experience stress and unhappy, so the yardsitck to move to sthithapragna (totally in the state of peace) is how much your peace when the object is taken away. Its not possible from moving unknowing to unknowing state, but its possible to move from knowing (finite) to infinite. Lord Buddha say three things first disease, second old age and finally death this made a quest for self realisation.

Kamakami has force which will make to grave for the desire if they aren't controlled. When Kamaka deterates it becomes `trishna` merely begging for that desire. When we vibrate at a higher frequency than something else, that is attracted to us. If we are at lower frequency, it is repelled. The power of materialization is activated only in one with a pure mind. Otherwise, if all our thoughts materialized (yogis say we get 64,000 thoughts a day), it would cause havoc within ourselves and others.

**Attach, you lose. Detach, you gain**

This is symbolically shown by Lord Vishnu and Goddess Lakshmi. Mahavishnu is the supreme energy of maintenance while Lakshmi is the energy of wealth and abundance. They are partners so much so that Lakshmi is in Vishnu's heart. At the same time Lakshmi is shown as pressing Vishnu's legs while Vishnu is very calm and relaxed. The meaning here is that wealth and abundance automatically comes to assist one who is detached, complete and peaceful. This is an internal state of mind. The right actions (karma) are still required.

Anxiety (kama) about wanting to do the spiritual sadhana regularly is okay because it is in doing the Sadhana that we learn how to convert the Kama to Ichha. So it is okay if Mumukshatva is a kama, it will convert to Ichha through Sadhana.

When setting a goal, be like a child. For example, a child doesn't have vague goals, the child says "I want ice cream". In the case of emotional goals, you can't set S.M.A.R.T goals. That only complicates what is an intuitive process. Be simple, e.g., I want to give love and receive love.

Sadhana: Practise the things which makes you peace, and start reducing the things which is creating lot of stress.

A Sthitha Pragnya is one in whom the wisdom is established. A common pitfall that occurs in the spiritual path is that the ego makes us believe that we are established. That soon leads to stagnation and then downfall, what Lord Krishna refers to later as Yoga Brashtaha. How do we know that the wisdom isn't established in us? In general, we have appreciation for what we don't have. For example, if we have 2-3 BMWs, we don't have a high regard for acquiring another BMW. So when I think it's great that I have figured this out and feel satisfied, then that means that I am not yet at that level because if I were, I wouldn't give that much value to it. For the Sthitha Pragnya, the wisdom is established and there is no concept of "I", so there is no feeling that "I" have achieved it. The puranas and scriptures depict the asuras and rakshasas with power as those who have done tremendous tapas, such as Ravana and Hiranyakashipu, but who have devolved because of their ego. The gods, rakshasas and asuras are all energies within us. However much I progress in the dream, I am still the dreamer. When the wisdom is established, the dreamer becomes the waker. At every step of the spiritual path, proceed with sincerity and put in the effort, and the Guru shakti will guide. The line from Kama Kami to Sthitha Pragnya tells us that we are on the path.

How to differentiate between Kama and Ichha? If the desire arises by itself in an uncontrolled way with the goal of becoming happy by achieving that desire, it is Kama. If the desire is brought about by us for functional reasons while recognizing that we are already happy, then it is Ichha. As we go about in the world and are in midst of situations and experiences which once gave us joy, we may be confused now as to whether our desire is Kama or Ichha. Don't analyze at every point (except if it is an extreme addiction) as that will lead to analysis paralysis, just continue performing the actions, and the personal Sadhana will refine us.
