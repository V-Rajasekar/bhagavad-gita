- All the aspects of our life can be classified into Sattva, Rajas and tamas which will give us tremendous clarity for to assess ourselves for our evolution and growth.
- All of us will have all the three Gunas Sattva, Rajas and Tamas, it will vary in proportions. By doing regular Sadhana we should keep increasing our Tamas to Rajas, Rajas to Sattva and Sattva to Trans Sattva.
- Our real Guna will surface only when we are facing obstacles/challenges and we should be objective, observe and use it for our continuous improvement.
- Sattva is calmness, inner peace, dynamism and external success. Rajas is a combination of internal peace/agitation and external success/failure. 
- In giving and taking the Satvik person’s focus will be always on giving, the Rajasik person’s focus will be biased towards taking and Tamasik person’s focus will be only on taking. 
- `ātma-kāraṇāt` One who cookes for themselve meaning one you act in selfish bhave that is mearly taking the taking the benefit in his act will eat sin meaning they will be agitated(not peaceful).
- We cannot be calculative in all aspects of our life. Everything cannot be business like, our focus particularly in any relationship should be always based on love and affection. In business it can outcome based but in relationships it should always be unconditional love and affection

**Parasparam and Athmakaranath**

- A Rach ashik persons bhavana is impure. His/her motive was selfish, his action, thoughts are selfish. 

- Whatever is happening in the life is based on the bhavana? A person with good, and wealthy bhavana 

- A Rach ashik is selfish, He starts off nicely that is the giving and taking is proper, but due to the impure bhavana the give and take proportion detreated.

- A Rach ashik person is always calculative, he see what is the benefit he has in the transaction, due to be calculative, he misses the quality

- Finally play of ego. Spiritual sin is separation from the totality(Infinite) that’s where the ego arises, and manifest in a tamasic person as I only exists, nobody else. The ego manifest in a Rach ashik person as kartutwa bhavana I'm doing, I'm giving. The bhothrutwa bhavana I'm the enjoyer 

**Principle to practise.**

- Parasparam  Maintain a balance in the give and receive. Do not be a receiver all the time, when you're not giving back, or not contributing, but only consuming all the time you’re a thief.
- A relationship long lasts only if the give and take are balance share your love, share the duties in your relationship
- Athmakaranth When you act selfish in your action, your making sin. Our thoughts, emotion and actions should be selfless
When you give your bhavana should be pure, that is don't act with the ego like I'm the giver.
