He continues the character of a person Sthithapragnya in this verse. The Ocean remains unmoved as the water enters from different direction, in such a way in whom all the objects of desire entire, not the desirer of object that person remains peace. The most important facet of Sthithapragnya is peace and its covered in the verse 70 and 71. Everything we do today is to attain peace, happiness.

We try to acquire different things in our life externally, however, in acquiring many things , we are seeking only one thing and that is happiness and peace. These external objects that we try to get is for our internal peace/happiness"
The goals in our life can be divided into three parts -
1) External - the objects that we acquire from the world
2) Subtler aspects - acquiring skills that requires both external help and internal effort
3) Spiritual growth - That is completely from within oneself. Inner transformation - bringing a change in oneself
To be in a state of Sthithapragnya is to be established in the higher wisdom eternally

`Sadhana:` Try to penetrate your own mind to find out what your seeking? Going deep your own action, emotion, You are currently seeking many things right now like wealth, health and relationship. But in all the seeking you ultimately seek is peace.

Don’t let my preconceived notions limit my experiences. Don’t impose restrictions on my life or on others. Be aware when I see myself doing this and pull myself back to an open minded state like a baby.

Though there are many different Gods, the infinite is only one. The forms are a way we focus our energy instead of the formless reality

You go through different experience in the life, but at the end what your are seeling is peace and happiness. The mind is under ilussion that it seeking manythings in life. You cannot draw line on how much many money you want? How much you want to have the sense enjoyment? You cannot draw a line because the mind is under illusion what ever your getting is less? and you have to get more.

`sa śhāntim āpnoti na kāma-kāmī` meaning of this line. 
`If your very clear with what your seeking is peace it doesn't matter how much you have, you will feel peaceful`, if your more caught up with that illusion, you will not be peaceful, but don't stop from acquiring wealth, don't become thamas, but bring this clarity that where you want to go.

What gives the Power to a Sthitha Pragnya when an individual is transformed to a Sthitha Pragnya? The Power comes from Shanthi or inner peace.

Most people lead mechanical lives. We are caught up in our daily activities and so enmeshed in them that we don't have the time to question why we are doing an activity. "Yoga Maya" puts an illusion over us and we are robbed of our time and before we know it 20-30-40 years have passed. As Adi Shankara says "kala kreedathi gachhat ..." - time sports with us and eons pass. How to break this? Put in the effort to become aware and request the Guru Shakthi. Be deep and refined in every action. Do it deeply or don't do it at all. Goals give direction to our actions.

As we go about various activities in life, even though the activities are different, they are all performed with the same ultimate goal, to obtain peace. A purposeful action is that which achieves the goal. If we acquire wealth or a relationship and that causes us stress, it isn't purposeful. Instead if it is done in a way that gives us peace, that action is purposeful and will help us, even though that peace is temporary, because we will be more calm during personal Sadhana which gives us the permanent inner peace. Lord Krishna says later that all of us have to act; we cannot not act. What the great Yogis figured out was that if we perform any action while being aware that we are doing it to obtain peace, we will automatically do it in a way that results in peace. We will also seek objects and perform actions (how we speak, think, feel and act) that reduce agitation and bring us peace.

Just as an ocean is unmoved by the waters that enter it from all quarters, so does one obtain peace in whom the objects of desire enter, not the desirer of objects .

Samudra refers to the ocean. The quality of the ocean is Paripoorna . Poorna is complete and Paripoorna is being completely complete, complete in all dimensions. The divine aspect of Paripoorna is also illustrated in the Maha Shiva Dhyana and in the Eesa Vashya Upanishad. That which it came from is complete and Infinite. That which came from it is complete and Infinite. That which is left over is complete and Infinite. We feel that we are incomplete and hence seek to "complete" ourself. I am already Paripoorna completely complete.

All gods are divine energies within us that we have not tapped yet. Ganesha represents the energy of success. Goddess Lakshmi is said to come from the ocean when being churned and represents not just wealth but every type of abundance - wealth, relationships, etc. But the secret mystery behind Goddess Lakshmi is that she also represents inner abundance. As an aspiring Yogi, focus on achieving the external abundance by recognizing that it is a manifestation of the inner abundance. The Upanishads describe the path of evolution and devolution. Dharma leads to Kama (in this case Ichha) which leads to Bhoga which leads to Moksha. Adharma leads to kama (uncontrolled desire) that leads to Aasakthihi (attachment) which leads to adhogathi (destruction). In the very middle of the Gita in the 9th chapter, Krishna says "Yoga kshemam". Here yoga refers to internal happiness and kshemam refers to external happiness or bhoga. Lord Krishna says focus on "me" (here, the Infinite) and you will get both internal and external happiness.

The feeling of gratitude makes us appreciate our Paripoorna.

Sadhana homework:
Every morning, express gratitude to the Supreme, the Guru and other holy masters, parents, spouse, children, friends. As we feel more grateful, we feel more whole.

- An imperfect mind projects its imperfection on the other person, more so on a Sthitapragya. Never judge a saint, a sthitapragya, it is a bad karma. 
- An imperfect mind cannot project the state of a Sthitapragya. The only way to know the depth of the ocean is by getting into the ocean. The only way to understand what a sthitapragya is by becoming a Sthitapragya

- When in the deep ocean, the only way to experience the entire ocean is when we let the ocean engulf us, and that's when the "I" becomes invisible and we merge into the deep ocean of the Infinite presence. 

- A Sthitapragya may externally look different but deep within he/she experiences the Infinite peace which stays Achala (without any movement, or without any disturbance). 

- All 24 avatars of Lord Vishnu look different externally, but the inner state of the peace of every avatar is always the same, unaltered. Lord Krishna, despite of the external challenges, he is always with a smile, with that bliss and happiness. 

- Staying in the state of Paripoorna brings in that peace. A Sthitapragyna experiences a state of peace even after removing the object of desire, and that state remains unaltered from before the acquisition of the object of desire (kaama).  

- Stop depending on the world for your happiness. It is not being said to stop being in the world, without which it is impossible for our existence. We should stop "depending" on the world for our happiness. 

- Peace is already something within. It is not acquired/achieved from anything external. 
- Examples of Lord Vishnu's concert being Maa Laxmi, and Shiva's concert being Parvati were depicted for the sake of a story, but each form of the Infinite itself was Paripoona with itself. They were complete in their own form already. 

- Similarly, Peace is already within us. We have inherited from that Infinite. Peace is our birth right. When we observe our own actions, whatever we do, we do it to get Peace eventually. 

Sadhana tip:
-----------------
Anything you do, do it with peace, cheer, happiness and bliss...

The purpose of the verses by Lord Krishna is self-improvement. The action of going deeply within every verse through the Yogic approach also teaches us to be deep in everything in life. Identify the cause for a situation where I need to improve (e.g., being timely) through deep introspection instead of automatically first looking for solutions. Be deep 

Spirituality doesn't mean running away from the experiences or challenges. People are in one of two extremes, either over-attachment or running away. Our goal is to experience everything the world has to offer and remain peaceful. Our ultimate goal is to be a Sthitha Pragnya. Both a Sthitha Pragnya and anybody else have the peace within. The Sthitha Pragnya experiences it. A Sthitha Pragnya can be from any culture, place, religion, etc. Meditation is a simple process of going within. Through impressions over births and births, we have forgotten it. Going deeper into meditation means going deeper into oneself. Through the Yogic approach, the Master revealed the divine meaning of the word Aapnothi. Aapnothi means to experience. When Lord Krishna says sa shanthi aapnothi he means Go inward to experience the peace instead of outward seeking the peace . When we look for peace outwards as a Kama kami, the objects of desire disturb our peace. Instead if we do Aapoorya mana achala pratishtham Samudra , we expand our consciousness through Sadhana and let the objects of desire enter us like the waters enter an ocean from all quarters.

The Samudra or ocean has waves at the top and is completely calm deep within. Likewise, at our surface we are agitated by whatever the world offers but in reality we are at peace deep within. Experience the peace instead of seeking the peace.

Prathistham refers to the process of getting more and more established as we go deeper. There are two ways of thinking about this. If we associate with the physical body, we are deeply affected by everything that happens to the body. Next if we go deeper inward (similar to going deeper into the ocean) and associate ourselves with the pranic body, we become more established and we relate to everything about the Pranic body. Next as we go deeper inward into the mano maya kosha (the emotional body), we become more established. Next the wisdom body, then bliss body, then jeeva atma and then Paramatma. Another way of approaching this is to consider the five bodies to all be present next to each other. We can go deep within any one body (symbolically go deeper from the surface of the ocean) and reach the Infinite. For example, during Kaya Tatva empowerment meditation, Yogishri made us go deep within the physical body to the subatomic level and beyond. Thus the Infinite is there within everything if we go deep within since the Infinite is present everywhere. For this reason, in fact, peace is not just within us, it is an aspect of us. Tat tvam asi Aham brahmasmi

Turn the direction of seeking inward

The Puranas are full of stories such as the one where Veda Vyasa requests Ganesha to write the Mahabharatha while he dictates. In response to Ganesha's condition that he continuously dictate (a phenomenal task considering the Mahabharatha is 4 lakh verses, of which 1 lakh verses are known to us), Vyasa put the counter-condition that Ganesha shouldn't write anything he doesn't understand. This automatically made Ganesha contemplate each verse in depth which gave Vyasa time to compose the next verse. When Vinayaka began writing, he broke one of his tusks to use it. The deep meaning of this is as follows. The two tusks represent the opposites in life, e.g., joy and sorrow, heat and cold, etc. We are always swinging between these two extremes. Ganesha's breaking the task represents the act of not going to the extremes and being in the center. So Ganesh is referred to as Dvandhva Atheeta, one who is beyond the two extremes.

Sadhana Tip
Expand my consciousness through sadhana and let all of life's experiences enter me fully. I am the peaceful deep ocean.

Objectively do the Sadhana
Our personal Sadhana makes us aware of the impurities that have come out. We notice our ego more, not because our ego has increased but because we become more aware of our ego. As we become more aware, don't stop the efforts and continue doing the Sadhana with objectivity.

__Nov 7, 2021__

The Bhagavad Gita is beautifully constructed. The first chapter and the first dozen or so verses of the second chapter are presented to first outline the problem at hand, namely, Arjuna's sorrow. To resolve anything, we first need to become aware of our problem. Then Lord Krishna begins with inspiring verses to first uplift Arjuna because he isn't a mental state to listen to any advice. As Arjuna inquires about the qualities of a Sthitha Pragnya, Lord Krishna goes into depth on this question because becoming a Sthitha Pragnya is what we want, whether we realize it or not.

When Shri Rama Thirtha was asked why are people greedy, he replied "Why not?". He said, "Everyone is seeking the Infinite. When they don't get it from the finite, they want more and more." At some point, everyone's search turns inwards. What is the difference between a Sthitha Pragnya and another person when it comes to God. A Sthitha Pragnya has realized that he is part of the Infinite whereas we haven't yet realized it. Our initial goal should be to be a Sadhak. A Sadhak has realized that his goal is the Infinite while a Sthitha Pragnya is Self-Realized and has realized that the Self is part of the Infinite. Initially, we seek to merge with the Infinite but actually the Infinite actually opens itself to us with Sadhana.

Lord Krishna later describes Sakama and Nishkama. The first is to perform spiritual practice to attain a common goal like health, wealth etc, and stopping or stagnating with that. Nishkama is to have the goal of going inward to merge with the Infinite. Along the way, you attain all worldly goals too, but keep in mind the main goal.

Another dimension of Aapoorya Maanam was revealed by the Master. We have to experience the world from all quarters fully to progress spiritually. Mumukshatva is the desire to be liberated from the finite. It doesn't mean running away from the world as you have to experience the external world fully so as not to be agitated when you are in the inward journey. 

As we do Sadhana and we become more aware of our areas to improve, one may question whether one can become a Sthitha Pragnya as we experience agitations and self-doubt. But remember that it is only a deep ocean that experiences waves not a shallow body of water, so experiencing the surface waves of agitation is itself a sign of the depth within like a Samudra . Self-doubt is a hindrance to spiritual progress. Be self-confident like Sita Devi became after seeing Rama's ring offered by Hanuman.

Sage Valmiki used to be a highway robber called Ratnakar who robbed and murdered people. Sage Narada visited him recognizing that he was ready for the higher empowerment and asked him why is committing these sins to which he replied it was to help his family. Ratnakar tied Narada to a tree and demanded his money. Narada said he only had his Veena that he used to sing the glories of the Lord. Ratnakar refused to believe him. Narada touched his third eye and gave him the first empowerment. Ratnakar internally saw the baggage of his karmas, the sins, and on Narada's suggestion, asked his family members if they would accept the consequences of his actions, to which they all said no. Ratnakar realized the folly of his actions and made his way back to the Sage with haste and fear, and falling at his feet, asked him what he could do. Narada gave him the second empowerment, the divine mantra of Ram and asked him to repeat it. The baggage of his sins was so much that Ratnakar could only say Mara (what he used to shout after killing people). Narada said that's okay, repeat Mara with the Bhavana of Ram. It is Bhavana that matters. Withing a few times, Mara became Rama, Rama, Rama. Ratnakar became the great Sage Valmiki who composed the Ramaya.

The Master gave this story to illustrate that if a person like Ratnakar can become a Sthitha Pragnya like Sage Valmiki,  why do we have to doubt our capabilities? Use the power of choice and self-effort to remember that the fact that we have agitations means that we have the depth within us and to use self-effort to explore the ocean with regular Sadhana and the grace of the Guru.

Valmiki’s story teaches us important lessons:

No matter who or what you are and what external wealth etc you possess or what sins you have accumulated – these are not factors that either guarantee or reduce your eligibility for spiritual ascension. Instead, the major determinants of spiritual progress  are :

   1.	Your sincere efforts
   2.	Purity of Heart
   3.	Possessing the Right Bhavana

The most precious gift one can aspire for in this human life is the attainment of Peace.  A sthitha pragnya is one who is established in the Peace of the Infinite- Deep seated in the Infinite Within!

A non- sthitha pragnya and sthitha pragnya are not two different people, instead it is a phase of transition from non-sthitha pragnya to sthitha pragnya for which one has to journey within and find the Peace that emanates from the Infinite within!

A sthitha pragnya which is a potential possibility in each one of us is compared to an Ocean!  On the surface of the ocean there are waves while deep within is the stillness, quiet and peace of the Ocean. The waves are likened to the expression of an individual while contacting the world.
The three aspects of Peace that an ocean depicts which are found in a sthitha pragnya are:

   1.	A sthitha pragnya is at peace with himself, he is neither bored nor agitated when he is left in solitude. 
   2.	He is at peace even while contacting the world.  The waves that are seen are superficial and represent the turbulence caused by the people and circumstances in real life, but they actually do not affect him.  He contacts the world and executes his responsibilities without being agitated by the realities that confront him, either in the form of people or in the form of different circumstances.  
   3.	He is deep-rooted in the peace of the Infinite within him and he emanates peace which can be felt in his surroundings. The peace from within him spreads to his surroundings.

The Sadhana tips are – we need to be calm and `learn to enjoy and accept our own company` when in solitude see what is the good and bad things you did or happen to you it will be like seeing a moving where in you will see the mix of comedy, drama, horror all will be there, When the mind is free from agitations, one enjoys peace even when left in solitude.  

Second- `when your operating in the world what is the level of peace?` How much of spiritual energy are you carrying and maintaining when you contact the world? through your medidation you can maintain the spirtual energy and peace.

Third `How are you interacting in the world? How is your expression? How others feel your company?` when an individual is established in the Peace of the Infinite, then he emanates peace which fills his surroundings and all those who come in contact within him.  Just as the coolness of the air is felt in the beach way before one approaches the sea so also the peace emanating from the sthitha pragnya can be felt in his surroundings.

we need to accept people and situations as they are.Acceptance should be a choice and stem as a show of strength and should never be acceptance due to inability.Acceptance is the first step and it is a mental attitude. When you dont accept people or situation then you start expecting unrealistic expectation,when you assess people then you confirm the reality of the lifes. Work without expectation, but it doesn't mean don't have expectation, all it means is your expectation should be align with the reality, so when your reality of life and expectation are mismatched then it cause stress.
You have no control over others, but you have control over the expectation. How to deal with the person ? How to act and speak with the person? find a solution. Remember a yogi doesn't complain people he always think how to handle the person or situation. if you start complaining then 

when you join the samdidhram and sadhna you get these three powerful steps number one when your all alone by yourself creating spiritual energy, second when your contacting the world being so much established in the spiritual energy and it never reduces finally the postive expression you eminate makes others around you feel comfortable.

Sadhana tip- Practice acceptance of people and situations and take the right measures to resolve the problems that occur. 
Unacceptance or expectations that do not match with reality lead to stress and loss of peace.
