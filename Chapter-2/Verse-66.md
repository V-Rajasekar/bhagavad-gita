        नास्ति बुद्धिरयुक्तस्य न चायुक्तस्य भावना |
        न चाभावयत: शान्तिरशान्तस्य कुत: सुखम् || 66||

    nāsti buddhir-ayuktasya na chāyuktasya bhāvanā
    na chābhāvayataḥ śhāntir aśhāntasya kutaḥ sukham

There is no intellect for the one who is not united; And for the one who is not united there is no faith; And for the one who has no faith there is no peace. For the person without peace how can there be happiness?

"An one eye man is the king of blind kingdom" never thing you have achieved so much in life because the achievement you have achieved is negligable when compared to the human potential. Set a higher goal or higher reference point within yourself never set a reference point outside the world like refering or comparing to a person because that will disturbe your mind and you will never be peaceful. 

There is no intellect when you are not doing your action with full bhav (i.e) whole heartedly. if you do things half heartedly you will thing about those issues in those actions and you will never be peaceful if your not peaceful you will never be happy in life.

The key principle in this verse is being yukta (united with one, energy are integrated). To be an yukta you have to gather all your engergy. when your yukta you will become successful in life because your focused. If you are not a yukta you will be a confused person your decision make will be poor.

When your energy is not focused then you won't have the bhavana. The dimensions of `Yukta`
1. `Yukta means united or joined with the spirtual aspect (infinite).` 
  - Practise - Every day reconnect with the infinite by doing meditation (yoga sankithan) it has the positive  energy and vibration.
  - Its not practising the external things(Pooja) is not matter, but being united with the infinite within you. 
  - Connecting with infinite will enhance your consciousness.
2. `Yukta means being arrangement in orderly (Organized).` It is at the intellect level you need to practise your thoughts in a orderly way. If you want clarity  of things you have to organize your thoughts. Whether you are having a conversation or eating food your thoughts will run every where, so get your thoughts organized and structured only pickup those task which help you to accompolish it. By practising organizing your thoughts
    - Your ability to read situation and others mind is developed
    - EOD before go to your bed do a interaspection run through the activities you have done from the morning till night. This will make you aware how organized your in life.
3. `Yukta means being observed intent (focus)` Doing things fully absorbed and focused on anything he do in life.  There are two aspect in this dimension one is the concentration anything you do do it with full concentration the mind will always run after something bring your focus
fully on the work your doing next is the emotions behind it. Be cheerful your emotions should be positive don't be a dry person be cheerful 
do your work as a passion with positive emotions dont thing its a drugggery. When your a cheerful person people like you.
4.  `Yukta means being filled` This is at pranic level at the level of life force energy. The more your are able to back your action with emotion. The more power you'll be able to generate. This creates more impact on yourself and on others. Pickup those things in your life which increase the pranic level the kind og foods, information
5.  `Yukta means being active, being diligant` It means overcoming the tamas and lazyness. Not allowing the laziness get in your system which is following a discipline. 
6.  `Yukta means being very skillfull and being experienced` Each one have unique talent like engineering, art, music. You should put in effort develop the talent and become skillful in that area. Its not only skillful as you 
put more effort you became more experienced. You should go on improving skill, and practise to become experience
and over a period of time you will become the master.

You have to follow all this principles in your life, because its like a chain if one is broken you can't function properly, if your not organized then you won't be able to focus, if you pranic (breathing) is fluent because of emotion you can't focus. 

When it comes to applying this principle on an any given situation you have to choose the dimension of the yuktaga and apply it. There are two goals one in absoulte that is being united with infinite the supreme power.

 Second the relative goal, you have to have relative goal in all aspect of your life like health, relationship, carrier, wealth. `If you don't have a relative goal you will act mechanically without any delibration in life. When you act mechanically then you will go with whatever life is taking you, then you will quickly lose your control over your life your situations, you will start grumbling.`

 First if you want to decide on which aspect should i use in any given situation first fix a reference point and the reference point is goal. Once you have a reference point (goal), next what is the best method to achieve the goal or which dimension to be used to achieve that goal. 

 Let us say your working hard in your office and the stress is too much, so much of task is there and stress is building and your unable to handle the stress, so much of work, so much of task is there to complete it in limited time.
 First ask what is your goal? My goal is i want to complete all these tasks within this given time. what is your level now? My level now is i'm worked up stressed, next ask the question among this dimension which dimension i have to use to reduce the stress.One might be pranic level doing a deep breath to reduce the stress, next organizing the work that is giving a time slot for each task (i.e) from this time to this time i will work on this task.
