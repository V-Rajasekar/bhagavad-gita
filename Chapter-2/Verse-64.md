    Free from likes and dislikes but moving among
    sense objects with senses controlled by the self, 
    the one who has achieved self-mastery attain peace.
```

To evolve spirtually and rise from moha you have to free from likes and dislikes, here free from likes and dislikes doesn't convery live a dry life that is no with no likes and dislikes rather don't allow your likes 
and dislikes influence your decision making. For an example if you like eating processed foods don't influence your like to make a decision to eat it. First ask the question is this benefits me if not don't it. 

Similarly waking up early in the morning doing Krias and Sadhana does it benefical to me eventhough you dislike waking up early in the morning if its benefical you have to adopt it. In each  and every moment of your life you make decisions based on your likes and dislikes, so examine your likes and dislikes before making a decision and go ahead with that action.

`Your likes and dislikes shouldn't influence your decision`
`Your likes and dislikes should not initiate action on there own`

If you were to go about examining each and every likes and dislikes in your like now throughout the life you will only be examining your likes and dislikes and you will never get on with your experience in life. If you want to practise this `rāga-dveṣha-viyuktais` 

`Step-1` is fix a higher goal in your life. If there is no goal then there is no direction to your likes and dislikes, the higher the goal the better. The goal can be a mere self-centred goal or an expansive goal. 

Krishna says fix your goal as self-realization sthita prakna(person who attained perfection) incase if it is too high for you then fix your goal as Atma suthiki (self-purification) self-development goal, then your life takes a wonderful direction. 

`Step-2` consider what is your swadharma? broadly speaking what are my likes and dislikes ? what are my desires? what do i love to do in life?, so choose your field of activity considering your broad like and dislike. You cannot paint don't take that activity

`Step-3` Formulate a daily schedule. If you don't have schedule in your life then your likes and dislikes will start taking over they just take you where ever they want.when ever there is a clash with your schedule, then examine the situation and take a decision

Instead of your likes and dislikes influence your decision and initiate your actions. You should allow the goal you fixed in your live, and the schedule which you have formulated to influence your decision and initate your actions.

Fix a goal in life, you should not be directionless when the river flows it requires a direction, any force, power requires direction a river with no banks can come and inundate the fields and come and destroy everything. Similarly your mind has tremendous power your likes and dislikes your emotions all this facets of mind requires a direction, and what give you a direction is goal, and fix the goal high something selfless 

`viṣhayān indriyaiśh charan` means but moving among sense object. when ever you contact world you get stuck with experiences in life and you don't move away from the experience. When ever you contact the sense object neither indulge in it and get stuck nor completely withdraw from the sense object rather keep moving from the experience, so the word charan here means moving. `Learn to end experiences mentally when the physical experience end.` `  ātma-vaśhyair` means senses controlled by self here Vashyaga has two dimension first it means taming something, influencing or mastering the sense objects the second dimension is wish, desire, willpower, so how to master the senses is by developing a strong willpower. When you develop strong attraction towards a sense object without your consicousness then it becomes kamaka, but with consciousness it becomes itchashathi willful desire. 

when an experience is very intense then the awarness become less, so when an experience is very very intense if you take few secs break and watch yourself and shifting your focus from the experience to yourself just for a split secs instantly the awarness get awareness will get awakened. `Tip` watch your breath incase of joyful experience the breathing will be normal, incase of bad experience the breaking will be fast and hot

How to develop willpower?

Developing willpower is similar to developing muscles like biceps, and pushup when your developing the muscle you willingly go through the pain, when you embrace that pain because its benefical for you the muscle develops over a period of time. Its same thing willpower cause pain when you try to develop it. 
(e.g) Wakingup early in the morning.

As Buddha says `Learn to embrace the pain.` Fix small small goals maintain disciple and achieve the goal, this will develop willpower. 

Keepup your commitments, commitment to yourself and others
