### Sadhana practise

> 1) Experiencing fully where you don't have weakness and withdrawing where you have weakness.
> 2) when you work in selfish way it will lower your consciousness, but when you work for higher cause, when you day seva it raises consciousness.
> 3) Remove/Filter irrelevant or negative informations and also observe what are the kind of input am I taking it willingly.
>4) When ever your effected by anything immedetiatley split the experience in to two. One is the triggering factor outside and other is the reaction with in you.
>5) *I'm **not able**  to express my thoughts in a discussion or meeting*. 
>**Instead say** "***I choose*** *to not to express my thoughts in a discussion or meeting*."  what ever you choose from your depth no force in the world can prevent you from doing that.
>6) Dont meet the problem half way let the problem meet you dont spin your opinion on that problem which basically agreegate it. Don't play a screen in your mind whether the other person will accept what your saying.
>7) when ever you get time start observing what is around you(e.g)things in your living room. Go in details of that observe it in detail and then close your eyes and try to recall this will increase the `smrithi`shathi in you the moha will loose his power in you.Great monks like Swami Ramakrishna, Vivekananda have practised it.It will give you sharpness and this helps smartness.
>8) If you know which way you fallen then you automatically know which way to raise. As `Albert Einstein` he said
 ```
 Every problem has a solution, and the solution lies within the problem itself
  ```
  When your solving a problem penetrate fully and understand the problem, without understanding the problem fully when you try to solve the problem you will make mistakes.

  Understand the concept and principle to avoid superfical solution.
 >9) Start developing the `aspects of buddhi (verse 63)` so buddhi is not just gaining knowledge learn to analyze clear and learn to decide clearly and that awarness.
 >10) Everytime your gaining knowledge don't close your mind by getting in to a feel yes, I know instead feel I begin to understand. 

 ## what is life ?
  Our yogi's say life is `Anubhava dhara` means a flow of experiences. If you want your life to be wonderful then the flow of experience to be wonderful, and if you want the flow of experience to be wonderful then you have to ensure each and every experience wonderful. 

   One way is to see your life as a whole and other way is to see your entire life as one experience, if you put your heart and soul in each of your experience then the entire life will be one of high quality. But what we do is ignore individual experience we ignore quality and more concern about the quantity. 

   Dropping the tendency to rush through life without how your functioning at micro level(e.g) if a batsman play every ball properly automatically he will hit the centuries. This is the secret of life, so you should be your heart and soul in each small task.

   Once the follower of Budhha asked about what is the origin of universe? Buddha said you should penerate first. He took a flower and asked his students to mediate on the flower, the students mediated on the flower by closing their eyes. Buddha asked what did you see they said we mediated on the flower look petals, its color and smell. Buddha you should go further deeper. where does this flower come from its from tree, and then its origin is from a seed. By the end of the origin you will get to the origin of universe. 

   `when ever you want to do something ask yourself will this action will be good for me good for others also if the answer is yes do otherwise avoid it`

   > Fix a goal, follow your swadharma and formulate a schedule to direct your likes and dislikes to make a decision and take a action. 

   ` Do your duties properly and you will get your rights and rewards`
