That person, who having abandoned all desires,
moves about without craving, without the sense of mineness,

In verse 70, Lord Krishna was referring to the internal state of a Sthitha Pragnya. Now he is talking about how a Sthitha Pragnya acts in the world.

The Kama mentioned in Verse 71 by Lord Krishna is the uncontrolled desire. Charathi is moving or acting. The significance of Charathi with Shanthi is to break the misconception within me that action or effort leads to loss of peace  Instead of thinking external object, person, activities reduce my internal peace, think strong peace within me influences the outside world. 

It is through the sadhanas, doing yoga, exercise, and resolving the unresolved action one can be peaceful internally. 

How much you are in peace when your interacting in the world ? It depends on how much your doing the sadhana, the yoga sangithan, the yoga, exercise, but its very very important how are you interacting in the world the (practicality).Right now you wull have some challenges in your life, may be its in the work, relationship your mind thinks if these challenges aren't there then you will feel happy. It will try to escape from that challenges, task.If you are suppose to finish a task and itsn't finished in time then you won't be peaceful first complete the item to be peaceful.

When ever you have unfinished job then that will ruin your peaceful of the mind. How to tackle this unfinised job? Not by escaping from the challenges, but rather acting on the challenges.

**How to conqure the fear? Do the things that are fearful to you.**

In this verse and several other times in Chapter 2, Lord Krishna uses the combination `"yaha" and "saha" `or `"yasya" and "thasya".` *Whoever does the things mentioned, that person will become a Sthitha Pragnya. We strongly believe that only some divine people can become enlightened. This is due to our conditioning in this life and previous births. Yogishri gave the story of a tiger cub which had been brought up by deer and kept thinking it was one of them. When a tiger came to hunt all the deer, this tiger ran with the rest of the deer. The hunting tiger caught this tiger and took it to a pond and showed their images and said "Look, we are the same. You are a tiger". We are like the tiger thinking we are a deer due to all of our impressions and conditioning.

The ancient wisdom gives equal importance to both the internal and external worlds. Internal application of the principles help us in purification while external application helps us to live our life fully.

The situations we experience are what are needed for us to work out our karmas and grow spiritually. So we should not leave the world and shirk our responsibilities.

We have to balance these 2 facets of our life. Should neither ignore the external worldly life nor get lost in it. This is the path to move from a kaama kaami to Sthitapragnya.


**That person who having abandoned all desires moves without craving, without a sense of mineness or ego, attains peace .**

If we step back for a minute from deep within the verse and look at the Gita overall, we can see that when expounding to Arjuna and, in reality, to all of us, Lord Krishna continually weaves the two equally important applications of the ancient wisdom - internal transformation and purifying external action. It's not enough if we learn how to drive a car in a street with no traffic (personal Sadhana when we are by ourselves), we need to learn to do so in a crowded street with traffic (i.e., our external actions). Later, Arjuna asks Krishna "Thadekam Vada", "Tell me one thing" - Should I learn the wisdom or should I act? Krishna doesn't give a simple answer because of the nature of the question. If somebody asked you to give a simple response to Should I inhale or Should I exhale, you will say both are important and depending on the situation or particular instant you have to inhale or exhale.

The Yaha Saha and Yasta thasya combinations are used regularly in the Gita.  Last week, the Master explained how it is symbolic of the fact that anyone (he who does certain things) can become a Sthitha Pragnya and that this transformation isn't restricted to those from a specific religion, caste, creed, culture, country etc. Today the Master revealed the hidden secret in between the two words yaha and saha . Bhavana alone isn't sufficient, the corresponding action is required. In fact, bhavana which isn't followed by action isn't true bhavana. When we are hungry, don't we eat? Do we come up with some excuse and not eat? 

`"yaha" and "saha" ` Even a person who committed most sinful, but if he decided to change and purify himself and attain enlightment. Here the bhavana, or intense, and action is more important. You have to be discipline, punctual in your sadhana to become good at anything. Its the union between the intension and action.If you want to chang something in your life then you have change the pattern, the thinking and action because these are the things that does the change.

We are creating our life every day through our bhavana, emotions, thoughts and actions (namely my energy field) which lead to certain outcomes. So if we want to change the outcome, don't we have to change our bhavana and actions? If we want a good relationship, not only do we need the Bhavana of unconditional love but have to follow up with action of kind words and deeds.

*When having a positive Bhavana, don't stop with that and implement it through action.
Likewise, purify the Bhavana while performing activities
The Bhavana and Action need to be in sync*

If I am delaying my Sadhana, e.g., not watching the Gita discourse at same time every week, this act of delaying will lead to delays in other aspects of my life. That's the energy field I am creating.

In response to a Sadhak's question about how can the soul be purified when it is already pure, Yogishri reminded us not to mix spiritual levels. From the absolute level, the Paramatma, the infinite soul, is pure. From the relative level, the Jivatma, the individual soul has got impressions. Suppose we are in a dream wherein Yogishri tells us it's all an illusion. Now in the dream, we are chased by a tiger and we call Yogishri on the cell phone. He tells us to climb any nearby tree. At that time, it is pointless for us to say everything is a dream because if so we won't be affected by the tiger chasing us. For the dreamer, the tiger clawing and the pain is very real, so the Master gives us the solution for that. So we shouldn't mix up levels. The highest truth is for inspiration while the Sadhana tips are for daily transformation.

**Sadhana homework:**
Examine specific aspects of my life with problems and see if the Bhavana and action are in sync.

Sadhana what is my intension ? what are my actions? If your action is not insync with your intension then your not following this principle `yaha and saha`

If you don't follow this principle you either become a dreamer or blamer.Neither you should be a dreamer nor a complianer be realistic(be in present).

**_Jan09_2022__**

The Master continued to reveal the yogic secrets in verse 71 of chapter 2 in the context of the  principle of Yaha and Saha.
 The cause is needed for the effect.

**Our Bhavana and Karma need to be in sync to achieve our goal.** If someone has only the Bhavana but does not put in the corresponding action, that person becomes a dreamer only. If someone does actions mechanically without the right Bhavana, that person becomes a complainer.
 The actions won't be synchronized with the person's goal. Examine the aspects of your life and see which extreme you are in each aspect.

Spirituality is not against wealth or abundance. In fact, this is considered as Goddess Lakshmi. The Master gave the wonderful story of Adi Shankara who upon getting a nellikkai from a lady who had nothing,  chanted the Kanakadara Stotram which showered her with wealth.
 Goddess Lakshmi represents not only external wealth but also inner wealth, the peace.

To have a desired effect, the appropriate qualifications are required. That person who fits certain criteria and performs certain actions evolves to become a Sthitha Pragnya. The mind craves the effect without focusing on the cause. Both Bhavana and Karma together make up the cause (karana) for which the effect is the fruit that is deserved and desired. You get not merely what you desire but what you deserve; you need to be qualified to get the fru*you need to be qualified to get the fruit*. If both Bhavana and Karma are there, nothing in the world can stop you.

Some words of verse 71 refer to Bhavana and some words refer to Karma. Without craving, without the sense of mineness and without ego refer to Bhavana. Abandoning (uncontrolled) desires and "moving" relate to Karma. Sarvan (all) is related to both Bhavana and Karma.

Since "Puman" (root Pumsaha) is used here, some might mistakenly take it to refer to only male. It is used here because a male is talking to a male but is actually indicative of human kind. When Krishna talks to the gopis in the Bhagavatam about how to give unconditional love, the word for "female" is used there. But in both these cases, the word used is indicative of the wonderful qualities and infinite potential of human beings in general.

There are four dimensions of "Puman". First a male or female who functions mechanically. Then going beyond male or female to a human being who exerts the power to choose every moment things (and also emotions and thoughts!!) which don't agitate us and which give us long-term peace. Only human beings have the power of choice. 
The third aspect of Puman choosing to expand one's consciousness to merge with the infinite soul, the Paramatma. The way to do this is to diligently follow what the Guru says and perform Sadhana. A Master is one who is not stuck at the consciousness of body, prana, emotions or thoughts but has expanded the consciousness to merge with the Paramatma. 
The fourth aspect of Puman is having the spirit of being a servant, one who serves humanity. A yogi is connected with the Infinite in meditation and when functioning in the world sees everybody as a manifestation of that Infinite and therefore has Seva bhavana towards all. The classic example of this is Lord Krishna who washed the feet of guests at the Rajasuya yagna, and arranged the slippers of guests during the celebration after the Mahabharatha war. It was not his action that matters but his attitude, the Seva bhav.


In response to a question on whether a place's culture can be an obstacle to yoga, the Master said choose the positive aspects of every culture, for example the spirit of open-mindedness and hard work in the US.
