WIth intermixed statements as it were, you are seemingly confusing my understanding. Tell me decisively one thing by which I may obtain the best.

Arjuna thinks Krishna is confusing him and is being indecisive. This reflects how confused Arjuna is. But actually, the Master responds to the student based on the real need not the stated question. The Master with a smile takes everything the student throws at him and yet still guides him. What a miracle!
