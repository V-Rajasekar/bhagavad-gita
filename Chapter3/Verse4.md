Arjuna felt that refraining from action in the battlefield will make him peaceful. Lord Krishna tells him (and us) that not initiating action is not the way to peace. Lord Krishna breaks Arjuna's preconceived notions that are preventing his growth. Every Master does this. One of the dimensions of Nishta is fixety - being fixed to the Infinite. The nature of the mind is to be fixed or attached to something. A true master will not show a student how to simply be detached but how to be attached to something higher, the highest being the Infinite.

the Master might say that wealth won't give you happiness to a student who is fixed on wealth and will say that wealth is important to a student who thinks wealth is a source of unhappiness.

The main principle of **this verse is avoid escapism.** We all have a tendency for escapism, to give up on something. For example, people start thinking of retirement soon and then premature retirement. When Yama came to a Master who was giving healing during meditation and said, "Your time's up", the Master said, "Give me two minutes, let me finish the healing I am giving this person, and then I will come with you". Perform your duties till the last minute of your life; the nature of the duties may change. Keep learning and updating yourself.

Do not do things in a mechanical way. Understand the purpose.The cowherds at Brindavan were mechanically worshipping Indra. Krishna
changed their action by advising the people in Brindavan to worship the Cattle and Govardhana mountain.

Today I learned the sadhana of Arambha and its dimension

1. Arambha means to start
2. Arambha means doing your duties with full commitments and responsibility.
3. Arambha means doing your duties in time.
4. Arambah doing your actions in fast and timely manner
5. Arambha means contributing to the society, to the nature world.


**Sadhana of Aarambha**

Initiate new actions. It's a misconception that spirituality means you should be out-dated. The reason for that misconception is because the mind has a weakness for things from the past. *Sanatana Dharma* means not only ancient wisdom but wisdom that is eternal. It doesn't change from the past to the present and will be the same in the future.

Bring freshness to actions. Approach each day as a new day. Go with the natural flow of experiences. Start with the experience, feel the peak with full awareness and end the experience when it ends. There is a reason the past is called Erandha Kaalam (dead time); don't live in the past.

Bring commitment and responsibility to actions. Overcome Tamas.

Be timely. Set your goals with a reasonable timeline to achieve the goal. Put your focus and effort to fullfill that goal. Do not delay the actions because it will make you thamas and it results in withdrawal from that goal.

Put in effort. Don't expect things for free. In a later verse, Krishna says, "One who eats without producing is a thief!"

Sadhana homework:
**Reflect on what actions you have been delaying.**

Bhagavat Gita starts in the GuruKshetra battle field an eternal wisdom given in the battlefield, how to act in a battlefield. A life is a battle field in each and every moment of our lifes there is always an internal and external challenges. One who is open to the challenges will be happy and peaceful in the life. We have to practise the sadhana to face the challenges the best of best things happens in your life when you face the challenges and not by simple ignoring the challenges. One such incident happened in the last world cu match 0n 2022
between IND vs PAK. India was no where near to achieve the target, because of Virat Kholi his tremendous batting gave us that victory.

In life not move away from the challenges face the challenges take responsibilities.
