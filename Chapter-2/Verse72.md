eṣhā brāhmī sthitiḥ pārtha naināṁ prāpya vimuhyati
sthitvāsyām anta-kāle ’pi brahma-nirvāṇam ṛichchhati

This is the state of Brahman O Partha.
Having attained this none is deluded. Having got established in this, even at the end of the life, one attains the ultimate liberation of Brahman.

In any scripture, the Masters adopt different methods to convey the message. For example, this could be in the language or style chosen or by making an authoritative statement. Lord Krishna makes an authoritative statement when he says "This is the State of Brahman". An authoritative statement can be made by one who is very egoistic or one who has no ego at all. How to differentiate between the two? There are two ways:

               When I make the statement, if the focus is on "I am right" rather than "The Message is right", then this is from the ego.
               An authoritative statement made from the ego unsettles the listener while an authoritative statement made factually out of   
               experience calms and energizes the listener. In the latter case, the speaker is also able to listen to the listener's point of view. 

It is important to be assertive but when doing so, emphasize only the message. A great thinker said, "The only way to win an argument is to avoid it."

When you become more experience in a field if you know something you will open to disclose, if you don't know something you will say I don't know you will not give wrong factuals. 

Lord Krishna also makes this authoritative statement to establish himself with Arjuna who had till now only seen him as a friend. So much so that Arjuna earlier had asked Krishna himself how a Sthitha Pragnya walks and talks when all he had to do was to observe Krishna. Arjuna had now started the process of surrender, so Krishna was able to take him to the next level.

The absorption of the wisdom increases with my receptivity. Past knowledge is actually a block for me. Tune in to the frequency of the Master.

When the majesty of the Infinite is conveyed through the limited finite equipment by the Master, some mistakes may occur. I am extremely sorry for having been judgemental in the past.

To absorb the ancient wisdom, practice Shravana, Manana, Nidhidhyasana and Abhyasa. Listen with the mind. Reflect. Internalize it with the grace of the Master and the Divine. Practice it in daily activities.

Receptivity increases with listening. Shakespeare said, "Give thine ear to all, but few thy voice."

In Verse 54, Arjuna has asked "Sthitha Pragnya kaa baasha?". For several verses through verse 71, Lord Krishna had provided the answers. But now in verse 72, he is talking about the Brahman!! When a Master tells a dreamer about the Waker, in trying to become a Sthitha Pragnya, the dreamer is actually trying to become a purified version of the dreamer and not the Waker! `The Brahman is the Infinite where there is no individual Sthitha Pragnya!! `It is like I am a salt doll. First I am dry, then become wet and start combining with the water, and eventually I am one with the water.

A poet said in the poem about a brook - "Men may come and men may go, but I go on for ever."

Sadhana Tip
Avoid arguments. Avoid egoistic assertions. But be assertive with factual assertions that are based on facts and my experience.

Why is that the ego reduces our power? Because when we focus on the ego, we focus on our problems. These have all been created by our ego, so they seem large when we focus on the ego. When we realize we are a small speck in the Infinite, we realize our problems are trivial.

In response to a Sadhak's question, the Master said the way to find time to do something extra in addition to your regular duties is twofold: 

(i) Don't think of the duties as an obstacle to what you want to do otherwise. Instead recognize that life is a whole. Enjoy the duties. Do regular Sadhana. You will start completing your duties. You will also need less time to complete the duties. Because you are enjoying it, the stress will also be less. The stress depletes energy. Enjoying the task keeps energy. Also, we can do the Prana Tatva breathing to increase the energy.
 
(ii) Identify and remove time wasters. This is true of your duties also.
Doing these two things will help you generate 50% more time.

Most people wear a mask when they interact with others in the world. A yogi is like a child, pure in daily interactions. At the same time, a yogi is like water taking on the shape of the container. A Master adapts the language and style to the psychology of the individual. When Karna went to drop off Krishna after the latter had come seeking peace to avoid the world war, Karna told Krishna that even though Krishna was from the opposing side, he was the one person Karna felt truly comfortable with.

The Bhagavad Gita is intended to be a mirror. Just as we look at a mirror to find and remove stains on our face and to check if we are properly dressed before stepping out, using the Gita, we identify and remove impurities within us, and also equip ourselves internally.

Surrendering to the Master means attuning to the Master so that the receptivity increases.

Esha Brahmi sthithi Partha.
Esha - Krishna uses the word "this" to convey that the Infinite is near and within us, not far away. Initially, esha means this body for us. Then as we go deeper, esha means our Prana, then our mind, then our thoughts, then our root discrimination, and finally the Brahman!
Partha - As Krishna reveals the enormous spiritual truth of Brahman to Arjuna, he is making sure Arjuna doesn't feel distant from Krishna. So Krishna uses the familiar name Partha (meaning son of Pritha or Kunti) to remind Arjuna that he is still his cousin. 

Having attained this, none is deluded
The root word of vimuhyathi is Muh or faint.
Everyone is in a state of delusion. Like a drunkard who doesn't realize he is drunk, the deluded person doesn't realize he is deluded.

When Christ said "Kingdom of Heaven" and someone asked "Where is it?", he said it is within you.

In response to a question on the right approach during Kaya Tatva and Prana Tatva meditation, the Master clarified that the instructions are to prevent one from sleeping off but that the actual energy being conveyed is what's important and not the words. Go with the flow of the energy rather than using the conscious mind to do certain things forcefully following the instructions.
