```english
From anger arises delusion. From delusion, confusion of memory.
From confusion of memory, loss of intellect.
From loss of intellect, total destruction.
```

An anger is only an example. Its only one of the modification so somebody who is not short temper, they might have someother modifications like (Fear). 

`bhavati` means arising and becoming (you become one with anger). This is a dangerous stage. Any emotions whether its good or bad as long as its under your control its fine. when it gets out of your control then it becomes dangerous. 

A good emotions like helping others. First earn wealth and increase your capacity to  give money to others. Never exhaust your capacity (e.g) If you have Rs 10, 000 don't give away all the 10,000 because you have exhausted your capacity your no longer in a position to help others.
Instead invest the money and increase your capacity and continuously help others.

An family person should split his earned money in to four parts. 
1. To fullfill his responsibilities and fullfill there dependents needs
2. Saving for future.
3. To enjoy at present
4. A little position to charity and for spiritual journey. May be 10-11%


 मोह is comprised of 6 dimensions(or diseases) of self-deterioration:-  
   
1. Loss of awareness: Awareness is spiritualty and moha is lack of awareness. 
Example: The case of the alcholic who felt that he was still himself even after consuming several pegs. A video recording by his wife of his own behaviour showed him his altered state. Use (abuse) of addictive substances always lead to lack of awareness since they are intoxicants by nature. They shrink one's aura.

2. Delusion: This is the word that has also been used in the translation of the verse. Delusion is disconnection from reality. 
Example: A person might be spooked witnessing the shadow of another person who is standing behind, say, a pillar and not in the line of sight of the first person. The first person perceives the moving shadow of the other person as a ghost when he/she is in a state of delusion. That person is consumed by irrational fear.
As one's consciousness rises, she rises above delusion. Arjuna, here, is also in a state of delusion. In the first chapter, he is appalled to even think of committing the heinous crime of killing wicked people. Krishna through his healing energy and wisdom raises Arjuna from his delusion by the end of the Bhagavad Gita.

3. Ignorance: This is an extension of delusion where the person lacks the wisdom of life. Example: A person believing in superstitions or a wealthy person mistaking people's respect for his clothes and riches as their respect for him. People tend to believe that a 'spiritual' person with a large following is bound to be a true yogi while in stark contrast, the Upanishadic masters hardly had any students.

4. Infatuation: The disease of constantly overrating a person or object.  
Example: A boy infatuated with a girl will be blind to the faults in her. True love is when a person corrects his partner when she is wrong. The fanatical "fans" of celebrities who tend to mimic the celebrity's lifestyle are also in a state of infatuation. Wealth is another classic example of a source of infatuation.

5. Lack of decision making skills: The mind of a person in a state of moha is clouded by delusion. Consequently, such a person lacks the clarity to take the right decisions. It is better to take the counsel of wise people while taking big decisions in life.

6. Pain: A person plagued by moha is in a state of great mental agony. He is so acclimatized to it that he just does not realize it which is a very dangerous state. The master tries to shake the person out of that pain because that person makes no effort to come out of it. 

Buddha was compassionate to the entire humanity because he could understand the states of moha everyone was in. 

Another story that Yogishri said last year that comes to me in this context (it was said in a different context though): When Buddha was giving a discourse to his disciples one day, a stranger came up to him, cursed him and spat in his face. The Buddha remained calm and did not react. All his disciples were furious at that man. The next day, the same man again showed up and this time begged for the Buddha's forgiveness. The Buddha asked whom he should forgive and explained to him that the person who spat on his face the previous day was someone else (someone possessed by anger) while the person asking for forgiveness is someone entirely different.

when you surrender to your guru and to the infinite and practise your sadhana you will not be caught up with moha. 

`smṛiti-vibhramaḥ` is a disease but in that problem itself lies a solution in that word smriti shakthi(increase presence of mind).

`Tip: Increase presence of mind`

```english
when ever you get time start observing what is around you(e.g)things in your living room. Go in details of that observe it in detail and then close your eyes and try to recall this will increase the `smrithi`shathi in you the moha will loose his power in you.

Great monks like Swami Ramakrishna, Vivekananda have practised it.It will give you sharpness and this helps smartness.
```

`Zen Story`

```language
A master was weighing flax seeds, and a student asked his master what is enlightment ? when do we know a person reached his enlightment stage?

The master said this flax weighs 10 kg.

The deeper message here is live in the presence is the true enlightment state.
```
 when a person caughtup with an emotion let it be fear, anger, jealousy that will lead to (`moha`)   he/she will not know what they are doing.

 Once you get in to the `moha` stage even if you want drop the emotion, that will start controlling you. then you lose sight of a reality(`delusion`)

 `delusion` means when ever you away from reality or facts that stage is called delusion.

The other dimension of `moha` is `infatuation` it means when you have extra value for something that is called infatutation, you should have right balue for eveything. Never follow someone like a celebrity, are spritiual guru and become fanatic(devotion), dont follow there manareasam. Appreciate there hardwork, what they are saying how did they reached to this point.

Respect someone on his/her field field dont do self doctoring, when you build a house dont mere go to a mason to construct a house, a structural engineer should play his part just for saving money don't do this and regret later.

*Moha* also means pain when your under the influence of moha the pain which you go through also you don't recognize you become impervious or *acclimatized* to the pain 

There is a zen saying 

```language
Before you come to zen mountains  look like mountains, rivers look like river, and tree look like tree

when you start practising zen(mediation) mountains look river and river look like mountains and tree something else there is a state of confusion you get into but then once you reach enlightment.

mountains  look like mountains, rivers look like river, and tree look like tree everything clear.

```

when you day I want to conquer *Moha* then that I stands here is ego which will not let you do so. First you have to come out the ego. By following these three yogas `karma yoga` `Bhagthi yoga` and `Nayana yoga` you can come out of ego, eventhough they are look like 3 dimensions there path is to overcome ego. 

In order to succeed in any field whether its is medicine, cooking, engineering e.t.c two things are very esstentials 
1. Knowledge pertaining to the field if you are engineering Horning new skills in their respective areas.
  Eventhough a person is knowledgeable when it comes to use those knowledge he/she forgets the knowledge it is because of the stress and this is because of `delusion (moha)`. It is because of the lack of `smirithi` shathi,
2. Increasing `Smirithi` shakthi by doing 
   1.  daily sadhana
   2.  observing your mind while doing an action. (when ever your doing some action suddenly observe your mind. You might notice your mind is thinking about something else with what your doing at that moment. Do this execrisce very gently don't force your mind.)
   3.  observer the objects around you, close your eyes and recall them after sometime.
   
`smṛiti-vibhramaḥ` means your presence of mind is not fully 100% there where your body/action is present. The cause for this problem lack of `Smirithi` shathi. The moha causes smrithi shathi goes away, when the smirthi shathi goes away you will be in confusion state you do serious mistakes, and embarrassment actions. `bhramah` means confusion and embarrassment

`smṛiti-bhranśhād buddhi-nāśho` From confusion of memory, loss of (buddhi)intellect then from loss  of intellect total destruction. In a lay man world manana means emotion and buddhi means intellect, but in sanskrit
manana also means intellect.

It's the level of understanding important morethan repeating the things you learned. 
`story` 
```language
Swamiji asked questions to a boy who are  you ? He told his name, that's your name but who are you I am a boy, I am a humenbeing...Boy repeated the same questions to his younger sister, so here the repeating the same with out understanding.
```

`There are two level ignorance one I don't know when information is given but next level of ignorance is i know but i don't understand so it takes a while to do sadhana for you to gain this knowledge and overcome that barrier which is understanding
`

The third level of ignorance is beyond intellect that is I know, I understand, but I don't have experience in order to get the experience you will have to go beyond intellect to get the experience therefore that only the sadhana of nidhidhyasana has been given.

For the first level ignorance (i.e) I don't know shravana was given that is listening and reading for gaining knowledge, for second level manana was giveen that is relfecting and for third level of ignorance(i.e) i dont have experience nidhidhyasana was given which is special yogic technic to imprint this wisdom in your mind.

The three aspects of buddhi are 1. intellect 2. understanding(manana) 3. Returning to consicousness.

```language
what is intellect ? 
There are 3 main aspect of intellect `first aspect is your capacity analysis`, to see the pros and corns. the purpose of analysis is to make a decision. If you are go on analysis (over analysis) you are seeing pros and corns, but not able to make decision then its foolishness. so the `second aspect is decision making.`

when your developing analysis remember your analysis should help you to take a decision. Decision making is an important aspect of Leadership skills.

`The third aspect of buddhi is awarness.` which is very important its a deeper sadhana, compare to other previous two aspect which is important inorder to deal with world.

```

when he says `smṛiti-bhranśhād buddhi-nāśho ` A person in moha he cannot analyze properly he'll very very confused he cannot decide properly if your are in moha the mind can mimic the analysis (true buddhi) and not allow it analyze properly. when you are in moha you will loose awarness.

`Buddhi is not merely cramming up information you have to learn to analyse, learn to make a decision and awarness  `


The second aspect of intellect is knowledge, so when your buddhi is sharp your ability to get the knowledge will be more. Every information you collect should be used to open the doors(i.e) explore. Always be an eternal student as tatraya says. 

`Sadhana`
```Everytime your gaining knowledge don't close your mind by getting in to a feel yes, I know instead feel I begin to understand. 
```   

The third aspect of intellect is understanding and recalling that is called manana. the manna means the capacity to reflect/contemplate your understanding.
